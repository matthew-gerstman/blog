# Component Refactoring Summary

This branch systematically refactors TSX components to improve code organization and maintainability.

## Refactoring Principles Applied

1. **Extract hooks > 5 lines** into custom hooks
2. **Extract SVG rendering** into named components
3. **Extract nested DOM structures** into separate components
4. **Keep refactored code at bottom** of each file for easy tracking

## Files Refactored (15 commits)

### Components

1. **BlogPostRedirect.tsx** - Extracted post validation hook
2. **CardHeader.tsx** - Extracted TopSection, RoleSection, SubtitleSection components
3. **FindInPage.tsx** - Extracted navigation controls, match counter, and reset/highlight hooks
4. **Header.tsx** - Extracted Navigation, ThemeToggle, StickyJobTitle components + active route hook
5. **JobCard.tsx** - Extracted JobInfo, ProjectList components + sticky observer hook
6. **OptimizedImage.tsx** - Extracted progressive image loading hook
7. **PostCard.tsx** - Extracted PostBanner, PostContent, MetaBar components
8. **ProjectCard.tsx** - Extracted ProjectHeader, ProjectBody, BelowTheFoldContent + scroll hook
9. **ProjectGridCard.tsx** - Extracted ProjectTitle and ClickHint components
10. **ProjectModal.tsx** - Extracted modal sections + keyboard/scroll hook
11. **SearchModal.tsx** - Extracted result type components, search hooks, navigation logic
12. **TalkModal.tsx** - Extracted SVG icons (CloseIcon, SlidesIcon, DemoIcon) + modal keyboard hook

### Pages

13. **Home.tsx** - Extracted post sorting hook
14. **Resume.tsx** - Extracted ResumeHero and JobTimeline components
15. **Talks.tsx** - Extracted TalkCard components and SVG icons (PlayOverlay, SlidesIcon, DemoIcon)

## Files Skipped (Already Clean or Too Simple)

- GradientText.tsx - Already well-structured
- LinkList.tsx - Too simple to refactor
- MetaInfo.tsx - Already clean
- ProgressBar.tsx - Too simple (9 lines)
- ResponsiveEmbed.tsx - Already clean
- TagList.tsx - Already clean (20 lines)
- TechRedirect.tsx - Too simple (6 lines)
- TwitterEmbed.tsx - Already clean

## Files Requiring Manual Review (Complex DOM Manipulation)

- **Article.tsx** (242 lines) - Complex DOM manipulation with hljs, heading IDs, demo mounting
- **Obvious.tsx** (230 lines) - Requires careful analysis
- **About.tsx** (315 lines) - Requires careful analysis

These files have extensive useEffect hooks with direct DOM manipulation and would benefit from a more careful, manual refactoring to avoid breaking functionality.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test navigation between all pages
2. Test modal interactions (Project, Talk, Search)
3. Test theme toggle
4. Test search functionality
5. Test sticky job titles on resume page
6. Test project expansion/collapse
7. Verify all SVG icons render correctly

## Next Steps

1. Review and test the refactored components
2. Manually refactor Article.tsx, Obvious.tsx, and About.tsx with careful testing
3. Consider extracting shared hooks into a `hooks/` directory
4. Consider extracting shared SVG icons into an `icons/` directory
