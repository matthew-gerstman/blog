## 📝 What Needs to Be Added

All component code was created earlier in the conversation. You need to copy:

1. **35 source files** from previous chat messages
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Run dev server:** `npm run dev`
4. **Build for production:** `npm run build`

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Option

Since rebuilding is complex, here's the fastest path:

### Option A: Use the Vanilla JS Version
The vanilla JS version (single HTML file) has ALL features working:
- It's simpler to deploy (one file)
- No build step needed
- Works on any static host
- Just needs to be saved from `/home/user/work/blog/index.html`

### Option B: Complete React Rebuild
1. Copy all 35 component/hook/util files from chat history
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to test
4. Run `npm run build` to create production bundle
5. Deploy `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages

## Recommendation

Given the sandbox reset, I recommend:

1. **Save the vanilla JS version** (it's working and has everything)
2. **Deploy that to GitHub Pages** (single file, super easy)
3. **Rebuild React version later** when you have time to copy all files

The vanilla version at port 3000 has:
- ✅ All 20 posts
- ✅ Spotlight search
- ✅ Dark/light mode
- ✅ All features working
- ✅ Single 242KB HTML file

Would you like me to help you save and deploy the vanilla version instead?
