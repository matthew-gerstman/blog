      '<p>Last fall I joined a startup called Obvious. This is the most ambitious thing I\'ve worked on and I\'m so excited to share it.</p><p><em>Obvious creates things.</em> It reasons through complex problems, breaks them into steps, and produces real work: documents, images, websites, spreadsheets, whatever you need. It\'s an engine for building a business, a wedding, and day to day stuff around the house.</p><h2 id="what-does-that-actually-mean">What does that actually mean?</h2><p>Let me tell you what my family has been up to.</p><p>My mother-in-law teaches Hebrew school. She\'s been using Obvious to create learning materials—flash cards <em>in Hebrew</em> with AI-generated images, formatted as printable PDFs she sends to Staples. It builds her students <a href="https://prj_JIiGrCzH-8050.hosted.obvious.ai/jewish-communities-map.html">interactive maps</a>. It makes personalized study guides.</p><p>My wife opened an <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SimsyWhimsy">Etsy store</a>, where she\'s selling greeting cards. The cards were made by Obvious.</p><p>Obvious is the tool that drives our kitchen renovation, our smart home, and all of the projects you can imagine an old house needs. When we planned our honeymoon, it searched for reviews in French and Italian and found restaurants.</p><p>You will be surprised by how many problems Obvious can solve for you.</p><h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I got here</h2><p>I got access to Obvious in early October. I was immediately blown away. I\'d been using AI coding tools and had a rough sense of what a force multiplier AI could be—but I didn\'t have <em><span class="shimmer">the aha moment</span></em> until I tried this.</p><p>The team had figured out how to get an agent to break down complex problems and actually solve them. They\'d figured out how to put this in a web interface anyone could use. The agent has access to a shell and it\'s incredibly creative when you ask it to solve a problem.</p><p>I visited my brother-in-law and he suggested an app that could check if a phone number is fraudulent. We built it in two hours—without reading or writing any code. I later learned Obvious is happy to take a GitHub token and push its work wherever you want.</p><p>I got addicted to the product. I knew I had to work on it. I modeled myself after Tony Fadell trying to get into <a href="https://www.generalmagicthemovie.com">General Magic</a>.</p><p>I rebuilt my blog with Obvious to prove I belonged there. I wrote an introduction, <a href="https://matthewgerstman.com/obvious">built a landing page</a> mapping my resume to the job requirements. It felt like interviewing to work on the iPhone or the Mac. Something that mattered.</p><h2 id="what-were-building">What we\'re building</h2><p>We\'re trying to do for AI what Apple did for the personal computer. We want to make AI accessible for everyone, we want it to be easy.</p><p>This is the most fun I\'ve had working on something since Dance Marathon in college. If you know, you know.</p><h2 id="try-it">Try it</h2><p>We imagine a world of abundance, and I\'m giving everything I\'ve got to make that possible. If you try this product and feel the urge to spend 80 hours/week making this the best thing it can be, let me know. If you just enjoy using it, I wanna hear that too.</p><p><a href="https://obvious.ai">Click here to try Obvious</a></p>',

    content:
      '<p>Over the past couple of years, anonymous functions have really taken off the React community. A few days ago, I was on twitter and saw the following exchange:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">inline functions <a href="https://t.co/ISOsnigUtg">pic.twitter.com/ISOsnigUtg</a></p>&mdash; Kitze (@thekitze) <a href="https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/1175822194565361665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n</figure><p>Kitze was kidding (I hope), but for a while this was a very real debate. Especially when render props were first taking off. Since then, Hooks have made anonymous (inline) functions even more popular.</p><p>There have been a lot of claims of "this might affect performance" which is often countered with "well that\'s a micro-optimization." Up until now I haven\'t seen any real numbers, so I decided to get them on my own.</p><p>At first, I did this just by running a simple node script with various numbers for NUM_EXECUTIONS.</p><pre><code class="language-Javascript">function runAnonymous() {\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; NUM_EXECUTIONS; i++) {\n    (() =&gt; {\n      // noop\n    })();\n  }\n}\n\nfunction named() {\n  // noop\n}\n\nfunction runNamed() {\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; NUM_EXECUTIONS; i++) {\n    named();\n  }\n}\n\nconst startNamed = new Date();\nrunNamed();\nconst endNamed = new Date();\nconst diffNamed = endNamed - startNamed;\nconsole.log(`Named took ${diffNamed} ms`);\n\nconst startAnonymous = new Date();\nrunAnonymous();\nconst endAnonymous = new Date();\nconst diffAnonymous = endAnonymous - startAnonymous;\nconsole.log(`Anonymous took ${diffAnonymous} ms`);\n\nconst factor = diffAnonymous / diffNamed;\nconsole.log(`Thats a factor of ${factor.toFixed(2)}x!`);\n</code></pre><p>This code is hopefully straightforward. First it runs a loop where it generates an anonymous function and executes it, second it creates a named function then loops over it and runs it the same number of times.</p><p>For anything less than 10,000 executions I couldn\'t profile a difference. Both the named and anonymous executions took 0 ms.</p><p>At 10,000 executions we start to get some results</p><pre><code>Matthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 0 ms\nAnonymous took 4 ms\nThats a factor of Infinityx!\n\nMatthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 0 ms\nAnonymous took 4 ms\nThats a factor of Infinityx!\n\nMatthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 0 ms\nAnonymous took 3 ms\nThats a factor of Infinityx!</code></pre><p>Creating an anonymous function 10,000 times took about 3-4 ms to execute. I decided to crank it up a notch and see how many executions it took to see a real difference.</p><p>At a million executions I was able to see the named function actually take some time to run.</p><pre><code>Matthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 1 ms\nAnonymous took 3 ms\nThats a factor of 3.00x!\n\nMatthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 2 ms\nAnonymous took 4 ms\nThats a factor of 2.00x!\n\nMatthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 2 ms\nAnonymous took 3 ms\nThats a factor of 1.50x!</code></pre><p>These results were pretty inconsistent ranging from 1.5x to 3.0x. Just for fun, I decided to crank it up to a billion.</p><pre><code>Matthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 1240 ms\nAnonymous took 4117 ms\nThats a factor of 3.32x!\n\nMatthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 1053 ms\nAnonymous took 4153 ms\nThats a factor of 3.94x!\n\nMatthew at Matthews-iMac in ~/src/react-perf/src on master\n$ node anonymous.js \nNamed took 1054 ms\nAnonymous took 3798 ms\nThats a factor of 3.60x!</code></pre><p>Now we\'re getting some meaningful data. Creating an anonymous function and executing it takes roughly 3.5 times as long as calling a function that already exists.</p><p>This initial data tells me that anonymous functions don\'t make a meaningful difference to the performance of your application. In the above example we\'re averaging around 3 <strong>nanoseconds </strong>to allocate an anonymous function. For that to matter, we need to be operating at an unimaginably large scale.</p><h1 id="moving-on-to-react">Moving On To React</h1><p>The above example is pretty contrived. In a vacuum we see that anonymous functions have a negligible impact on performance, but what about in a real React application?</p><p>I decided to throw together a simple React application to see if anonymous functions made any difference to rendering a simple component. That looks roughly like this</p><pre><code class="language-Javascript">function AnonymousNumberList({count}) {\n  let list = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {\n    list.push(&lt;Number getNumber={() =&gt; i} key={i} /&gt;);\n  }\n  return list;\n}\n\nfunction NumberList({count}) {\n  let list = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {\n    list.push(&lt;Number number={i} key={i} /&gt;);\n  }\n  return list;\n}\n\nfunction Number({number, getNumber}) {\n  return (\n    &lt;h1 style={{color: number != null ? \'red\' : \'blue\'}}&gt;\n      {number != null ? number : getNumber()}\n    &lt;/h1&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre><p>In this example, we can render a large number of <code>h1</code> tags and see if using an anonymous function makes any difference from just passing a raw prop. I opened up the React DevTools and profiled how long it took to render each set of elements.</p><h3 id="without-anonymous-functions">Without Anonymous Functions</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>\n    <thead>\n    <th>Number of Elements</th>\n        <th>Time to Render</th>\n    </thead>\n<tr><td>100</td><td>5.1 ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1000</td><td>41.7ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10000</td><td>201.8ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>25000</td><td>518ms</td></tr>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="with-anonymous-functions">With Anonymous Functions</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>\n    <thead>\n    <th>Number of Elements</th>\n        <th>Time to Render</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tr><td>100</td><td>6.1 ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1000</td><td>43 ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10000</td><td>210.9 ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>25000</td><td>453 ms</td></tr>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This data is not at all scientific, but it was pretty representative of what I\'ve found. Having a single anonymous function as a prop makes no meaningful difference to React performance.</p><p>I did have one serious takeaway though.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FWIW I was trying  to profile if anonymous functions in a render make any difference to performance.<br><br>The short answer I found was &quot;not until you&#39;ve reached a scale where you have a lot of other lower hanging fruit to fix&quot;</p>&mdash; Matthew Trevor Gerstman (@MatthewGerstman) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewGerstman/status/1175897335378927621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n</figure><p>I thought my experiment was over, but Rick Hanlon had other thoughts.</p><h1 id="let-s-play-with-react-memo">Let\'s Play With React.memo</h1><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was thinking about doing the same today<br><br>What about<br><br>&lt;Root&gt;<br>&lt;Parent&gt; &lt;-- anon function<br>&lt;ExpensiveChild&gt; &lt;-- expensive render<br><br>Child should be pure/memo, the expensive render could be sorting a large array of todo items.

How does React behave when you give it a really expensive component to render?</p><pre><code class="language-Javascript">function sleep(seconds) {\n  const startTime = new Date();\n  const endTime = startTime.setSeconds(startTime.getSeconds() + seconds);\n  console.log({startTime, endTime});\n  while (new Date() &lt; endTime) {\n    // wait;\n    continue;\n  }\n\n  return;\n}\n\nconst ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(() =&gt; {\n  sleep(1);\n  return \'expensive\';\n});\n</code></pre><p>To do this, I made a sleep function that blocks the main thread for a full second and a component that calls it. I then memoized that component.</p><p>I quickly discovered that React.memo is memoization per instance as opposed to per set of props for that component. For 10 components, this code will always take roughly 10 seconds for the first render.</p><pre><code class="language-Javascript">function NumberList({count}) {\n  let list = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {\n    list.push(&lt;Number number={i} key={i} /&gt;);\n  }\n  return list;\n}\n\nfunction Number({number, getNumber}) {\n  return (\n    &lt;h1 style={{color: number != null ? \'red\' : \'blue\'}}&gt;\n      {number != null ? number : getNumber()}\n      &lt;ExpensiveComponent  /&gt;\n    &lt;/h1&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre><p>We haven\'t learned anything new yet, or at least nothing that isn\'t mentioned in the React docs.</p><p>Next up was profiling the overhead of React.memo. I decided to generate a big object with the following code.</p><pre><code>const bigObject = {};\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\n  bigObject[`${i}`] = `${i}`;\n}\n\n&lt;ExpensiveComponent {...bigObject} /&gt;</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>\n    <thead><th>Value of n</th><th>Overhead for React.memo</th></thead>\n    <tr><td>100</td><td>0.1 ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1,000</td><td>0.5 ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10,000</td><td>3 ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>100,000</td><td>100 ms</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1,000,000</td><td>675 ms</td></tr>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>These results were promising. I can\'t imagine a production scenario with more than 1,000 individual props. The overhead for memo is negligible for reasonable quantities.</p><p>In fact, I quickly realized that this isn\'t just the overhead for React.memo, <strong>this is also the overhead for prop spreading on the component.</strong></p><p>As a sanity check I ran the 1,000,000 prop approach again on a non memoized component. It took roughly 300ms to render that component. We can approximate that it takes 375 ms for React.memo to check 1,000,000 props.</p><h1 id="combining-with-anonymous-functions">Combining With Anonymous Functions</h1><p>As a final followup, I rendered my expensive, memoized component with an anonymous function as a prop</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;ExpensiveComponent anon={() =&gt; {}} /&gt;</code></pre><p>This did what I expected, it broke memoization. It once again took a full second for each render of each <code>ExpensiveComponent</code>.</p><p>While the overhead of using React.memo is negligible, this is a footgun to watch out for. An inexperienced developer could easily break memoization without realizing it.</p><p>To be clear, this has nothing to do with the anonymous function. This is because we\'re passing a new reference on each render to a memoized component. This code would also cause repeated rerenders.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;ExpensiveComponent obj={{ foo: \'bar\'}} /&gt;</code></pre><h2 id="a-note-on-science">A Note On Science</h2><p>This data isn\'t terribly scientific. I ran this experiment a small number of times on a single machine. In order to really collect data, we would need to run this code in a wide variety of environments many many times. I\'m not a statistician, so I\'ll leave it to the experts to run a truly conclusive experiment.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>That said, I am very comfortable with the statement that <strong>inline anonymous functions have a negligible impact on application performance. </strong>Use all the hooks and render props you\'d like.</p><p>You can see my full source <a href="http://github.com/matthew-gerstman/react-perf">here</a>.

    title: 'Surviving The Technical Interview',
    date: 'September 25, 2019',
    excerpt:
      "I've found myself giving a bunch of advise on technical interviews lately and thought it'd make for a good blog post. \n\nHere's my guide to surviving interviews.",
    content:
      "<p>I've found myself giving a bunch of advise on technical interviews lately and thought it'd make for a good blog post. While most of us acknowledge that technical interviews have a lot of false negatives, the industry as a whole hasn't come up with a better alternative. Here's my guide to surviving interviews.</p><h1 id=\"practice\">Practice</h1><p>This one seems obvious, but I need to say it up front. Practice, practice, practice. <em>Proper planning prevents poor performance</em>. I've personally done almost every problem in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2l8CeGG\">Cracking The Coding Interview</a> and I can't recommend that book enough. It helps you get into the mindset of interviewing.</p><p>A big failure mode with this book though is how it's organized. The problems are all neatly organized by what tool you need to solve them. For example theres a chapter with array problems and a chapter with tree problems. Real interviews won't be like this. You'll have to identify what tools to use on the problem when it's given to you.</p><p>The advanced chapters in the back are really helpful here because they don't provide any context, they're just problems to solve.</p><h1 id=\"turn-your-inner-monologue-inside-out\">Turn Your Inner Monologue Inside Out</h1><p>This is so important. As an interviewer I need to get a sense of how you solve the problem. If you silently struggle, I can't give you the hint you need to succeed. Talk to yourself as you work through the practice problems. It may feel silly at first, but you need to practice saying out loud what's going through your head. Really say out loud everything going through your head.</p><p>Even say out loud the bad ideas and why they won't work. During the interview, I'm looking for <strong>signal</strong>, either positive or negative that we should hire you. If you mention something that won't work and why, that's really positive signal. It shows me that you can think through multiple solutions and know their tradeoffs.</p><p>It's also important to state your assumptions. Sometimes it might seem like you intuitively figured out a key part of the problem, but I need to verify that. Often if a candidate seems to just know something I'll ask some followup questions that seem really simple, just to confirm we're on the same page.</p><h1 id=\"if-you-re-stuck-make-a-magic-function\">If You're Stuck, Make a Magic Function</h1><p>This one took me years to learn. When you're stuck on part of a problem, for example you don't know how to sort something, or organize a data structure, just pretend you have a function that does it for you. You will need to implement that magic function later, but this will help you get unstuck for the time being.</p><p>In fact, this is really positive signal for me. It shows me you can break down the problem into multiple steps, and that you can write clean code. It's often difficult to parse giant single-function solutions.</p><h1 id=\"take-a-deep-breath\">Take a Deep Breath</h1><p>During some interview somewhere, you'll probably get stuck and flustered. Don't go into panic mode. Getting stuck on a small part of the problem is totally okay, and expected. Take a deep breath and go back to the basics to wrap your head around it.</p><p>For on-sites, you'll often do several interviews back to back. Remember that each interview has no bearing on the next one. You can fail one interview, pass the rest, and that interview becomes an outlier. When you finish an interview put it in the past, and move onto the next one.</p><h1 id=\"i-m-taking-notes\">I'm Taking Notes</h1><p>This is important. I take notes throughout the whole interview to make sure I'm giving a fair evaluation. Here's what they might look like. </p><blockquote>5:06 PM Explained question<br>5:08 PM Candidate asked if they can assume a type of input, I say yes.<br>5:10 PM Candidate started writing error checking, i told them to assume it's valid input.<br>5:13 PM Candidate has the first part of the implementation.<br>5:14 PM Asked candidate to walk me through at a high level.<br>5:14 PM Candidates solution works like this ____________________<br>5:16 PM I asked what their data structure looks like.<br>5:18 PM They showed me they know what it looks like, now I can give them a sample input.<br>5:19 PM They're very caught up on this section. I'm asking them what would happen if they had a magic function to do it for them.<br>5:24 PM I asked what the code looks like for this simpler case.<br>5:29 PM Algo works for simple case, I told them I see a bug.<br>5:31 PM I told them \"I would wager they could make this function work for the advanced case\"<br>5:31 PM They figured out the advanced case.<br>5:35 PM There's a bug on line 33.<br>5:36 PM They found the bug on line 33 on their own.<br>5:40 PM I suggest a big scary edge case.<br>5:43 PM Candidate has a high level solution for edge case.<br>5:48 PM Candidate has implemented psuedocode around this.<br>5:53 PM We hit a good stopping point for questions.</blockquote><p>These are intentionally vague, but it's encapsulates the things I need to remember:</p><ol><li>How long did each part of the problem take the candidate?</li><li>When did they get stuck?</li><li>Were they able to figure it out the bugs on their own?</li></ol><p>After doing the same question dozens (or sometimes hundreds) of times, I have a pretty good sense of how the interview should go, what types of solutions a candidate may have, and when they're likely to get stuck.</p><h1 id=\"be-honest\">Be Honest</h1><p>It's very likely at some point you'll be asked a question you've seen before. There are only so many interview questions out there. When this happens, tell the interviewer! I can usually tell if a candidate knows the question in advance and it feels like I'm being lied to. When this happens, I have to flag this suspicion and recommend we reinterview them.</p><h1 id=\"it-s-a-numbers-game\">It's a Numbers Game</h1><p>Interviewing is it's own skill you need to hone; it can take years of practice. When I was going from my first to my second job I talked to 50 tech companies (and failed a lot of interviews). The more interviews you do, the better you'll get at it.</p><p>If you're just ramping up on a job search, consider scheduling the companies you're less excited about earlier. This will help you practice with less pressure. You'll feel more ready when you get to the interview you really care about.</p>",

This time let’s dive into all the fun things you can do with reduce. Before we do that though, let’s make sure we really understand how it works.</p><h1 id="why-s-it-called-reduce">Why’s it Called Reduce?</h1><p>I find it helpful if we look at the dictionary definition for the word reduce <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reduce" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><strong>[1]</strong></a></p><blockquote><strong><em>a: </em></strong><em>To draw together or cause to converge, or consolidate</em><br>Example: reduce all the questions to one<br><br><strong><em>b: </em></strong><em>To diminish in size, amount, extent, or number</em><br>Example: reduce taxes<br>Example: reduce the likelihood of war<br><br><strong>c: </strong>To<em> decrease the volume and concentrate the flavor of by boiling</em><br>Example: add the wine and <em>reduce </em>the sauce for two minutes</blockquote><p>In all three of these, we’re taking a group of things and consolidating, or shrinking them through some process.</p><p>In programming it’s the same. We’re taking a <strong>list</strong> of <strong>items</strong> and consolidating the list into to one new <strong>value</strong> using an <strong>accumulator</strong>.</p><h1 id="function-signature">Function Signature</h1><p>Now let’s take look at the function signature for reduce.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/500644ef1e9020822f10bd7b0aea69bc.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This part is pretty straightforward, reduce takes a <strong>callback</strong>, and an <strong>initialValue</strong> to seed the <strong>accumulator</strong>. Most of the complexity here is in the function signature for the callback. Let’s dive into that.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/d9647985a89f0dc4a76c4270a4c49554.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This is a bit more intimidating, so let’s break it down.</p><p>The <strong>accumulator </strong>is thing we’re trying to reduce our list down to. It <em>accumulates </em>the list of items into one value. That value could be an object or even a new array, but it’s considered one value.</p><p>Whatever gets returned from the callback is passed in as the <strong>accumulator </strong>to the next iteration. When we\'re done, the final state of the <strong>accumulator </strong>is returned as the <strong>value.</strong></p><p><strong>currentValue </strong>is less scary, it’s the current item in the list we’re iterating over. This might be more familiar if we use <code>for loop</code> syntax.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/977f044c735adba039b79a07f2df1c9f.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Next is <strong>currentIndex</strong>. In the example above this would be <code>i</code>. We can make this a bit more explicit though.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/4aa9c545944ae55a3cd0f306b161ef9b.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Lastly, <strong>list. </strong>This is the entire list we’re iterating over. This can be useful if you want to access some other element in the original list. To be honest, I’ve never needed to access the original <strong>list</strong>, but it’s available.</p><h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1><p>Now that we understand the function signature, let’s implement it from scratch. </p><p>One caveat, to avoid complexity this implementation takes the list as an argument as opposed to adding it to the prototype of array. You can see a proper polyfill at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce">MDN [2].</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/a13a16798ada747f047bb62637440014.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As you can see, the bulk of this function is error checking. We check to make sure we have a valid <strong>list </strong>and <strong>callback</strong>. We also ensure the user has either provided an <strong>initialValue</strong> or we can derive one from the list.</p><p>In fact if we assume that the user always provides valid input this is the entire function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/e62b0aa35577350a050211cdcb893f6c.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This function takes a <strong>list</strong>, iterates over it, and calls a <strong>callback</strong> on the previous value along with each item in the list. it then returns the final <strong>value</strong>.</p><h1 id="all-of-the-examples">All of The Examples</h1><p>Hopefully you now understand <strong>how </strong>reduce works, but it may not be clear <strong>why </strong>you would want to use it. First, let’s get the sample data out of the way. This is the same <a href="__GHOST_URL__/map-filter-reduce/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">data as last time.</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/b024143766f91edf8278415568aa235a.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="keyby">keyBy</h2><p>Now that we have the sample data out of the way, let’s look at our first example, <code>keyBy</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/6263edd4c352fcbcabc2b8415bec2bd3.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This function takes a list of objects and a key, and keys those objects by a property on them. In this example our <strong>initialValue </strong>is <code>{}</code>.We iterate over each item in the list, get <code>item[key]</code> and use it as our key in the accumulator.</p><p>As an aside, this implementation is naive and will overwrite on conflict.</p><p>Given the list of <code>wizards</code> above, we could call <code>keyBy(wizards, \'name\')</code> and get the following output.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/93f21471ba9d6ce80e9d9d5f41915360.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="groupby">groupBy</h2><p>Next up is <code>groupBy</code>, this function takes a <strong>list</strong> and groups the <strong>items</strong> by the output of a given function<strong>,</strong> or <code>iteratee</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/be19558f74230249742cbaa7de944bf0.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Again, we take a list, but this time we take a function, or <code>iteratee</code>. We call <code>iteratee</code> on each <code>item</code> in the list and use this to determine what key on the <strong>accumulator,</strong> or <code>acc</code>, we place the item in.</p><p>We then make sure there’s an array allocated at the key and push the item onto that array.</p><p>If we call <code>groupBy(wizards, wizard =&gt; wizard.house)</code>, we’ll get the following output.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/39070315478e7abd4198b87c3953354a.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="chunk">chunk</h2><p>Another popular example, <code>chunk</code>. In this case we want to take a big <strong>list</strong> and split it into a <strong>list</strong> of smaller lists.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/8185bfc898629b3ea9716c21cdfa5c53.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Above, we take a <code>list</code> and a <code>size</code> for our sub-lists. Our <strong>initialValue </strong>is an array with a single empty array inside of it.</p><p>We then iterate over the list and make our smaller lists. Every time one of our sub-lists reaches <code>size</code>, we move on to the next one.</p><p>If we call const <code>chunkedWizards = chunk(wizards, 3)</code>, we’ll get the following value for <code>chunkedWizards</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/eb44f0bf2033f53e889ef64ba024604e.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We now have 3 lists of 3 wizards. It’s worth noting that this worked out nicely because we had exactly 9 wizards. If we had 8 total wizards, our final list would be of size 2. If we had 10 total wizards, our final list would be of size 1.</p><h1 id="flatten">flatten</h1><p>We’ve chunked <code>wizards</code> into <code>chunkedWizards</code>, but what if we want to undo that? Well that’s what flatten is for.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/4f39158a4b0349807f36640011402a96.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this example we take a <code>list</code> and iterate over it. Whenever we see an array, we <code>concat</code> it with the <strong>accumulator, </strong>or <code>acc</code>. Whenever we see anything else we push it onto the <strong>accumulator</strong>. Our <strong>initialValue </strong>for our <strong>accumulator</strong> this time is an empty array or <code>[]</code>.</p><p>If we call <code>flatten(chunkedWizards)</code> we get our original list.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/c2e3823a0b063c3fc311eaa1e5e26333.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="flatmap">flatMap</h2><p>We can take this a step further with flatMap.

We iterate over the <code>list</code> and call <code>func</code> on each item.

      '<p>In this article we\'ll go <a href="__GHOST_URL__/functional-programming-fundamentals/">back to basics</a> and cover three of the most important functions in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/functional-programming-fundamentals/">functional programming</a>, map, filter, and reduce.</p><p>All three of these are useful functions for iterating over a list (or array) and doing some kind of transformation or computation. This will then produce a new list or the result of the computation done across the previous list.</p><h1 id="types">Types</h1><p>Before we dive into map, filter, and reduce, let\'s set up the list.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/ad7693f7583a07cf038bd38ab931152a.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As per usual, we\'re going to be operating on wizards. Each wizard object has a name, a house, and the number of points they\'ve earned for their house. Let\'s declare a bunch of wizards and put them in a list.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/44860c22b93656ab0391243e8f579666.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id="map-function map() { [native code] }1">Map</h1><p>Now that we\'ve got the boilerplate out of the way, let\'s dive in. The first function is the simplest one, map. Map iterates (or loops) over a list, applies a function to each item in that list and then returns a new list of the transformed items. Let\'s look at an example.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/c02b0634780f0e6c6ef00d5390e6ec42.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This function iterates over the list of wizards, gets their name, and puts it into a new array. The result of this looks something like this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/29ebae139d7839eb981fb110e9c1723f.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now in this example we were using a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/mary-had-a-little-lambda/">lambda</a> (aka an anonymous function), but we can also use a named function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/3d64ba545ca863db2fc3c6abd558abe7.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this example we have a function called <code>wizardToString</code> and we pass that directly to map. It will then return a new list that looks like this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/bf416ade6e4e95b9ce568a2df5449754.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id="filter-function filter() { [native code] }1">Filter</h1><p>Next up is filter. Filter behaves like map in that it iterates over the list, but it instead of transforming each item, it transforms the whole list. Filter takes a function that returns true or false or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/mary-had-a-little-lambda/">predicate</a>. It then returns a new list with items where the predicate returns <code>true</code>. Let\'s look at an example.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/fe6468ae65e0e7a1e11c9d726b09b0ca.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this example we filter over the list and only include wizards who are in the house Slytherin. The result would be this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/048d64ccc3719ba07a2b52a886bf6437.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As an aside, Taylor and Lin are two of the most acclaimed Slytherins of our day.</p><p>Just like with map, we don\'t need to use a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/mary-had-a-little-lambda/">lambda</a>, we can also use a predefined function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/884e4116282875442d860d44cb97eac3.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this example we make two lists, the list of Slytherins who have earned points (winners), and the list of Slytherins who have lost points (losers). We can see those results below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/496b2fa8c97d505d79f2aacaa1cb155e.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id="reduce-function reduce() { [native code] }1">Reduce</h1><p>Now we get to the most interesting function, reduce. Reduce iterates over a list and produces a single value. Let\'s look at an example.</p><p>Suppose we want to get the total number of points across all wizards. We can use reduce to do that.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/39da3b9782f8f3e4a59315c28a3523c9.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>What\'s going on here? Well reduce is a function that takes two arguments, a function and an initial value for the accumulator. The accumulator is the name of the thing reduce returns. In this case we start our point count at 0.</p><p>Now the function takes the current state of the accumulator and the item in the list it\'s supposed to process. For the first wizard, it will pass 0 for the accumulator. This function then returns <code>accumulator + points</code>. This will eventually sum up all the points. If you\'re curious, the result is 5487.</p><p>Now the accumulator can be anything, we can even use reduce to produce an object. Let\'s look at an example where we add up the points for each house.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/49909068b01b9285c0f18d6177a36b19.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this case, we initialize our accumulator or <code>acc</code> with <code>{}</code>. Then for each wizard we call a function that adds the number of points that wizard has earned for their house. If you\'re curious that result looks like this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/e4b620c523337b30cb44075b8be2bdd8.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Let\'s look at one more example, let\'s say we want the best wizard for each house. We can tweak our previous function to use the best wizard for each house.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/5428d9c0713e7ddab3dfa3a8beb675c6.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If you\'re curious, the result of that looks like this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/fdac1cee43ba855a48af1abe0ba86629.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Just a little more fun now, we can use <code>Object.values</code> to transform this map.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/98890f863a695769975f6eafebd2480b.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now we have nice strings for the best person in each house.</p><h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h1><p>Hopefully you\'re more comfortable with map, filter, and reduce now.

    content:
      '<p>In this article, we\'re going to talk about two of the most important functions in frontend development, throttle and debounce.</p><p>Both of these functions are commonly used to deal with situations where a user is causing an event handler to fire on repeat and we want to slow down the underlying function call. Think scroll handlers, keyboard events, or even just clicking a button rapidly.</p><h1 id="throttle">Throttle</h1><p>Throttle is a <a href="http://matthewgerstman.com/functional-programming-fundamentals/">higher order function</a> that takes a function and a timeout and only allows that function at most once per the amount of time specified.</p><p>Before we use throttle. Let\'s start with an example.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/c5d7a590204043ad7982946b3ca63a5c.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this example above we have a piece of state <code>numSpells</code> and a function that can increment this state <code>castSpell</code>. We have a button we can click that increments <code>numSpells</code>. You can play with it below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div data-demo="throttle-debounce-basic"></div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now you can click this button as quickly as you want and it will increment the number of spells cast. Now spells take some time to recharge, so we can use throttle to slow down the user.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/cc13aaffdcf78987efb8a61d403324bc.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We now have a button that call <code>castSpellThrottled</code> when the user clicks it. Try it out below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div data-demo="throttle-debounce-throttle"></div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that we understand what it does, lets dive into the source of throttle.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/d8d2090f84290dbcfe92ba51ef5dc6a8.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>What\'s going on here? Throttle is a function that takes a function and a timeout. Throttle returns a new function that forms a closure around the original one.</p><p>We keep track of a <code>boolean</code> called <code>ready</code> that stops the inner function from firing unless the timeout has elapsed. If we fire the function we also fire a timeout that will set <code>ready</code> to true when the timeout has elapsed. Pretty cool, huh?</p><h1 id="debounce">Debounce</h1><p>Debounce is a bit different from throttle. With throttle we slow down function calls as they happen, with debounce we don\'t fire at all until the user has stopped calling it.</p><p>This is really useful if you want to perform a computation or hit an api when the user is done typing or done scrolling. Let\'s play with another example.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div data-demo="throttle-debounce-debounce"></div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>You\'ll notice, you can click Cast Spell Debounced as many times as you\'d like, but it will only fire after you\'ve stopped clicking it. The source for this is similar to the previous component.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/d4fea64d5553a71058bbaef129d08d09.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that we know what it does, let\'s see how it works.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/f9b5c2df747a4e50b46ea4cc2e7e68b0.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>While the last one relied on a simple boolean, with this one we need to maintain access to the timer. We do this because we need to clear the previous timeout every time the function gets called again. We then set a new timeout to call the inner function.</p><h1 id="real-world">Real World</h1><p>Now these implementations of throttle and debounce were both very naive. If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/debounce.js">lodash source</a> you can see a much more advanced version of debounce that considers things like calling the function before or after we set the timeout.</p><p>It also allows fancy things like a <code>maxWait</code> and a <code>cancel</code>. They even implement <a href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/throttle.js">throttle with debounce.</a></p><h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h1><p>Hopefully you\'ve learned a bit about debounce and throttle.

Initially, HTML was completely static, requiring a full page reload to change. </p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- An entire web page could look like this: --&gt;\n&lt;form action="/api/doctor"&gt;\n  &lt;div class="row"&gt;\n      &lt;label for="actor"&gt;Actor: &lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input id="actor" placeholder="David Tennant"/&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class="row"&gt;\n      &lt;label for="companions"&gt;Companions: &lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input id="companions" placeholder="Rose, Martha, Donna"/&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;!-- Note: Many of these tags were unavailable in HTML 1.0 --&gt;</code></pre><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>appeared in <strong>1995</strong> and provided a weakly typed scripting language for handling events. It was only occasionally used to change the contents of the page. </p><p><strong>CSS</strong> arrived in <strong>1996</strong> and provided a new way of declaring the look and feel of a website, separate from the primary content in the document.</p><p>For dynamically rendered pages, we would use a language like <strong>PHP (1995)</strong> that could provide a server generated HTML document in response to a request. JavaScript was mostly sprinkled in to add interactivity to the page.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/history-of-the-web/html5-logo.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="550" height="518"><figcaption><em>Mosaic, One of the first browsers</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-dom">The DOM</h2><p>Things really got interesting when the<strong> Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> was introduced in <strong>1998. </strong>The DOM<strong> </strong>is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure. Each node is an object representing a part of the document. (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">Thanks Wikipedia</a>)</em></p><p>This provided a <em>mostly</em> consistent interface across browsers for JavaScript based applications to make changes to the content being displayed in the browser. Before the DOM, we had similar tree-based structures, but they weren\'t yet standardized across browsers. As a result, the APIs were wildly inconsistent. The function <code>getElementById</code> wasn\'t standardized until 2000. Keyboard event handling wasn\'t standard until 2004.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/blog/history-of-the-web/mosaic-browser.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="600"></figure><h2 id="s-websites-web-applications-g">s/Websites/Web Applications/g</h2><p>In the early 2000s websites began to go from simple pages to complex applications.

Web 2.0 brought about new expectations with regards to interactivity. Instead of statically generated sites, users uploaded their own content. This required lots of client-side business logic that was previously unnecessary.</p><p>Two of my favorite Web 2.0 era sites were Digg and Meebo.</p><p>Digg was one of the first social news sites, featuring user submitted stories and upvotes.

This meant application developers were left to deal with it.</p><p>jQuery abstracted that problem away. Instead of writing different code for two or three browsers, you could write once using a simple library. jQuery 1.0 was a decent amount of code, but we weren\'t concerned about bundle size yet, and we needed our stuff to work.</p><p>Code looked like this:</p><pre><code>var doctor = $(\'.doctor\').attr(\'data-actor\').value()\nif (doctor === "David Tennant") {\n  callRoseTyler();\n} else if (doctor === "Matt Smith") {\n  callAmyPond();\n}</code></pre><p>Furthermore it provided a simple interface for making API requests against a server, now we could do things like make API requests and issue callbacks in response to those requests.</p><p>This was revolutionary, and kicked off the next wave of complex web applications. Here\'s what the source of one of those applications might look like.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code>var companions = [];\nvar enemies = [];\nvar number = 10;\n\n$.get("/api/companion/1", function (companion) {\n  $(\'.name\', companion.name); // Rose Tyler\n  $(\'.seasons\', companion.seasons); // Seasons 1 and 2\n  companions.push(companion);\n});\n\n$(document).on("click", ".display_tardis", function (e) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  $(".container").html("&lt;img src=/tardis /&gt;");\n});\n\n// Another thousand lines of code that looks like this.</code></pre><figcaption>f</figcaption></figure><p>We\'re now hitting APIs, storing state, and changing page markup – sometimes at the response of a button. As these apps grew in size we had to figure out how to provide some structure. From there, we started to see MVC frameworks.</p><h2 id="mvc">MVC</h2><p>The Model View Controller pattern was widely popular on the backend and it seemed logical to bring it to the frontend. Most engineers were used to working with a backend MVC framework, and they could reason with the way frontend worked.</p><p>The two most popular frontend frameworks were Backbone and Angular.</p><p>In an MVC world we have a model for storing data, a view for presenting it, and a controller for the business logic in between. MVC is object oriented, with different objects having different functions. For example, models could sync their state against a REST api.</p><p><em>Aside: we were collectively really into the full REST pattern for a while, but we\'re mostly back to GETs and POSTs.</em></p><p>These frameworks were very much a precursor to the modern React ecosystem. They featured built in templating languages and separated the logic of updating the DOM and manipulating application state.</p><p>That said, state management was still difficult. Different models were constantly falling out of sync with each other and imperative DOM mutations meant race-conditions galore.</p><h2 id="bundle-size">Bundle Size</h2><p>This is when bundle size became a problem. While the dependencies weren\'t huge, we were writing so much code on top of it. We also weren\'t consistently serving minified or even gzipped files. It was also expensive to make a round trip to the server to serve some JS only to fetch some more.</p><p>To solve this, we needed to concatenate the files to reduce requests, minify them to reduce file size, and gzip them to reduce size over the wire.  This would often lower the payload size by 5x.</p><p>However the client still had to parse it! A few years ago, I profiled this and it took roughly 1 millisecond per uncompressed kilobyte of javascript to parse it and run it for the first time. Even with modern frameworks, each file has to execute at least once before the page is interactive to put all the functions in place.</p><p>Regardless. We focused on reducing the amount of code sent over the wire. That could mean shrinking it, or optimizing when we loaded it. It\'s important to remember that before this, we would serve each unminified source file separately.</p><p><strong>This was how we became obsessed with tooling.</strong> We needed to do a bunch of things to our code before we shipped it down. We needed to concatenate source files into bundles grouped by functionality, minify them, and put a hash in the filename for cache busting. It got complicated, and this lead to an entire ecosystem of tools: npm, grunt, gulp, and eventually webpack.</p><h2 id="language">Language</h2><p>After we introduced a build step, we were able to begin tweaking the language itself. In 2009 CoffeeScript was released. It was a brand new langauge that compiled to JavaScript and had new features like arrow functions, optional chaining, and modern string interpolation.</p><p>Much like jQuery ascended into modern DOM apis, CoffeeScript ascended into JavaScript. Many of its more novel features made their way into ECMAScript and we moved off of it.</p><p>In addition, we had libraries like underscore and lodash influencing JavaScript. ES6 gave us map, filter, and reduce right in the language. This rendered the bulk of these libraries obsolete.</p><p>In 2014, 6to5 (later babel) was introduced. This allowed us to write source code using the new ES6 (ECMAScript 6) spec without dropping support for older browsers. It worked by transpiling newer ES6 into ES5. </p><p>This was one of the biggest developments the web has ever seen. The ability to improve the language without worrying about old browsers. Development on ES6 was accelerated and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tech/es-everything/">TC39</a> were able to move to yearly releases.</p><p>CSS and HTML evolved as well. HTML 5 was released in 2014 and brought about a whole set of new tags we could implement against. CSS saw new dialects like SASS (2006) and LESS (2009) that were supported by the same build tooling we used for JavaScript.</p><h1 id="almost-there">Almost There</h1><p>We\'ve reached the point where the JavaScript ecosystem looked a lot like the modern web. Let\'s take a look at a very common stack in 2015.</p><ul><li><strong>Language: </strong>ES6 was new and CoffeeScript was still heavily in use. New codebases were using babel, but many were still in CoffeeScript or even ES5.</li><li><strong>Libraries: </strong>jQuery was evolving into everyone\'s favorite piece of tech debt. Lodash was still very popular.</li><li><strong>Tooling: </strong>Build tools like Grunt and Gulp were largely task runners. One was config heavy the other was code heavy.</li><li><strong>Performance: </strong>Serving had gotten faster, but we were still doing DOM mutations by hand which was slow and error prone.</li><li><strong>Styling: </strong>LESS and SASS were actually pretty good for their time.</li></ul><h1 id="modules">Modules</h1><p>We haven\'t discussed modules yet. For a very long time we would include JavaScript on a page via a series of <code>&lt;script /&gt;</code> tags and make sure to load it in the right order.</p><p>For a while there were two competing standards/tools for modularizing JavaScript: commonJS, and AMD (asynchronous module definition). ESModules weren\'t <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/">standard until 2018.</a></p><p>There were also a number of tools that shipped between 2009-2013, most notably requireJS. These tools provided a mechanism for isolating JavaScript and declaring dependencies within projects.</p><p>The problem was it was a nightmare to write. Here\'s what a standard file looked like with requireJS.</p><pre><code>requirejs(["jQuery", "underscore", "backbone"], function($, _, Backbone) {\n  // This function is called when all of its dependencies have loaded.\n  // Above, we have a 1:1 mapping of path to module export.\n});</code></pre><p>These require statements got sufficiently large and they were written by hand for a long time. </p><p>Webpack was first released in 2014 and it was the first mainstream tool to combine building and dependency management all-in-one. It included the new <code>import</code> statement which compiled down to whatever <code>require</code> statement was necessary.</p><p>We haven\'t even discussed Node, but around this time isomorphic JavaScript was becoming popular (running the same code on the client and the server).</p><h1 id="react">React</h1><p>Seemingly out of nowhere, Facebook released React at the end of 2013. There were a bunch of problems with the current state of web development and React aimed to solve them:</p><ol><li>We were intermingling business logic with DOM mutations.</li><li>We were storing data on actual DOM nodes.</li><li>Reading/writing to the DOM was expensive.</li><li>State management was a nightmare, everything was constantly falling out of sync with everything.</li></ol><p>In 2014 Facebook gave a now legendary talk titled: <em>Hacker Way: Rethinking Web App Development at Facebook. </em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYkdrAPrdcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>This talk detailed how they introduced React and adopted the Flux pattern to simplify web development. React made one simple promise, UI is a function of state.</p><p>The flux pattern works as follows. We have a datastore sitting at the top of our application, React would read from that datastore and render UI, whenever it needed a state change it would issue an action that updated the data store. This would trigger a rerender of the entire application.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/history-of-the-web/web-standards.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1280" height="866" srcset="/images/blog/size/w600/2021/05/image-15.png 600w, /images/blog/size/w1000/2021/05/image-15.png 1000w, /images/blog/history-of-the-web/web-standards.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><em>Taken from the<a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts"> Redux Docs</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>But there was magic! React introduced the virtual DOM which effectively eliminated the imperative DOM mutation problem.</p><p>React provides an interface for writing declarative components. This means you tell React <em>take this state and turn it into this UI. </em>What it doesn\'t do is tell you how to get from (State A, UI A) to (State B, UI B); React did all of that under the hood.</p><p>React would do a full render of State A, later it would do a full render of State B and then it would do a diff on two virtual DOMs (as opposed to the slow real DOM) and determine the minimum set of changes to make to the DOM.</p><p>React also introduced a syntax called JSX, a way to write html-like markup directly inside a JavaScript module. This allowed developers to create components with business logic adjacent to markup, without actually putting HTML strings in code.</p><p>This made applications both faster and more predictable, a win for everyone. Eventually, Redux became the most popular flux implementation. This led to the popularity of  <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tech/functional-programming-fundamentals/">functional programming</a> on the web.</p><p>Here\'s what some React code might look like.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">import React from "react";\n\nfunction TheDoctor({ number, actor, companions }) {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;The {number} Doctor&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;Played by {actor}&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;div className="companions"&gt;\n        {companions.map((companion) =&gt; (\n          &lt;Companion {...companion} /&gt;\n        ))}\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n&lt;TheDoctor\n  number="Twelfth"\n  actor="Peter Capaldi"\n  companions={["Clara Oswald", "Nardole", "Bill Potts"]}\n/&gt;;\n</code></pre><h1 id="typescript">TypeScript</h1><p>Over the years JavaScript kept getting better. We moved from big releases like ES6 to iterative yearly releases like ES2021. It only made sense that someone would add types.</p><p>TypeScript is a statically typed language that compiles down to traditional JavaScript. It enforces type checking at compile time however the runtime code is still untyped. This works well enough even if it\'s not perfect.</p><p>While TypeScript was first released in 2008, it didn\'t get mainstream adoption until a decade later, in 2019. As far as I\'m aware, Dropbox was one of the first companies to adopt <a href="https://dropbox.tech/frontend/the-great-coffeescript-to-typescript-migration-of-2017">TypeScript at scale in 2015</a>, or maybe I\'m just really proud of the migration we did.</p><p>TypeScript started to get good during the 2.x phase. These versions brought strict null checks, async functions, enums, <code>Pick</code>, and a whole range of utilities we take for granted today. Since then, it\'s become more and more powerful, and has quickly rose to be the most popular dialect of Javascript.</p><p>With the advent of types, we could now enforce contracts between different parts of the codebase.</p><pre><code>type DoctorProps = {\n  number: string;\n  actor: string;\n  companions: string[];\n}\n\nfunction TheDoctor({ number, actor, companions }: DoctorProps) {\n  // Function Body\n}\n\n&lt;TheDoctor\n  // Type \'number\' is not assignable to type \'string\'. ts(2322)\n  number={13}\n  actor="Jodie Whittaker"\n  companions={["Graham", "Ryan", "Yasmin"]}\n /&gt;</code></pre><p>If you\'re curious, I once gave a talk on why TypeScript is amazing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KdvEGPiULAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><hr><h1 id="the-mountain-of-technical-debt">The Mountain of Technical Debt</h1><p>All of that history, and we\'ve reached web development in 2021. We also skipped a lot: GraphQL, advancements in CSS (modules, styled components, etc), and the entire node ecosystem.</p><p>When looked through the lens that <a href="https://blog.professorbeekums.com/all-code-is-debt/">all code is technical debt</a>, there\'s a mountain. We\'re still building web applications using fundamentally the same tools we were 20 years ago: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p><p>They\'ve evolved quite a bit, but they continue to maintain support for every website ever built. Furthermore, any sufficiently large codebase will include artifacts from its past. How many of us claim to be running TypeScript + React, but secretly have some backbone, some jQuery, or some checked-in-decaffeinated CoffeeScript? And that\'s just the stuff I can think of.</p><p>Even with the latest features in ES2021, the vast majority of websites are still targeting ES5, a language released in 2009. We can add types and declarative runtimes, but it will eventually execute in a typeless and imperative environment.</p><p>Our obsession with tools has reached new heights. Let\'s take a look at a pretty standard setup for a modern application:</p><ul><li><strong>TypeScript </strong>- Adds support for types and newer ES features. Usually compiles to ES5.</li><li><strong>React 17 + React DOM  - </strong>About 35kb gzipped runtime that allows for declarative programming.</li><li><strong>Apollo - </strong>Popular graphql library for API requests. About 33kb gzipped.</li><li><strong>NPM - </strong>Package manager, supports pulling in third party dependencies (including the ones listed here).</li><li><strong>Webpack - </strong>Build tool, runs the underlying TypeScript compiler and handles minification, bundle splitting, etc.</li><li><strong>ESLint - </strong>Lints code for style and potentially runtime errors.</li><li><strong>Prettier </strong>- Code formatter, standardizes whitespace, quotes, and semicolons.</li><li><strong>CSS Modules - </strong>Allows importing CSS directly in JavaScript files.</li><li><strong>Jest - </strong>Unit test runner.</li><li><strong>Cypress - </strong>End to end test runner.</li></ul><p>That\'s a lot of tools! Today\'s web developers need to know about all of them, how they interact with each other, and how they interact with all that <em>legacy</em> code that isn\'t going anywhere.</p><p>The list keeps going, and the worst part, all of these tools are written in JavaScript, which leads to extended build times, test runtimes, and one dragged out feedback loop.</p><p>In fact, most of the recent developments in performance have been achieved by writing JavaScript tooling in other languages! The esbuild team saw 150x performance gains over webpack 5 by writing their bundler in go.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/history-of-the-web/modern-web-stack.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="800" height="150" srcset="/images/blog/size/w600/2021/05/image-16.png 600w, /images/blog/history-of-the-web/modern-web-stack.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Taken from the <a href="l">esbuild docs</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="page-loads">Page Loads</h2><p>This is just in our terminal! Even if we fix the tools, we still have to ship code down to the browser. Here\'s what an average pageload might look like.</p><ul><li>Http requests comes in to server</li><li>Server provides initial HTML markup</li><li>HTML is scanned, <code>&lt;script /&gt;</code> tags are loaded.</li><li>JavaScript comes down over the wire, is parsed and executed for the first time.</li><li>JavaScript code makes a network request for content over a JSON API.</li><li>API request comes back, JavaScript renders page, the page is finally interactive.</li><li>Lazy loaded code begins loading.</li><li>Modules pop into the page as we fetch and render code/content asyncronously.</li></ul><p>There are tons and tons of performance optimizations we can do here, but at the end of the day we either have to pay this cost in the form of time or complexity. Any performance optimization we do makes serving more complex and creates more places for our stuff to break.</p><hr><h1 id="the-future">The Future</h1><p>The two projects I find most interesting are <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a>. There are a number of competitors to React, most notably Vue and Angular 2. While they have their own approaches to application development, they still ship a runtime down to the browser.</p><p>Svelte is different, it has no runtime. It does all of its work at compile time so that you can send down as little code as possible. While Svelte hasn\'t been meaningfully adopted at scale, I believe whatever takes the throne from React won\'t have a runtime.</p><p>Deno is a secure runtime for TypeScript. Its built in rust and totally overhauls how we run v8 in the server. While it still runs V8, they\'ve largely abstracted that away from the user, allowing it to be swapped out in the future.</p><p>I believe we\'ve found the correct interfaces for web development. TypeScript and React provide an incredible developer experience with the constraints they\'re built on. What if we took TypeScript and React and honest-to-god compiled it. What if we could ship the React runtime as part of the browser? What if we took advantage of type data at runtime?</p><p>If we started to do this, we would take the existing paradigms frontend engineers are familiar with, but turbocharge their implementation. Until then, we\'re going to keep executing our code in the same environment we were in 1998.</p>',

Before we get to redux-thunk though we need to cover <strong>applyMiddleware.</strong></p><p><em><em>A note on embedded source: The most up to date redux source is <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/src">available here</a>.

These wrap the store and can modify it\'s exported functions. In this case, <code>applyMiddleware</code> is a store enhancer that wraps <code>dispatch</code>.</p><p>So when we create our store, we pass <code>applyMiddleware</code> with a middleware as the second argument.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/398b682e6c20d20e426e9334f01a3dec.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This second argument triggers the following block from <code>createStore</code>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/9388c9b6dd4c167424a05c6b72a49168.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Once again we\'re gonna be looking at functions all the way down. Enhancer is a function that takes <code>createStore</code> and returns a new version of <code>createStore</code>. </p><p>Upstream we\'ve passed <code>applyMiddleware(thunk)</code> as the <code>enhancer</code>.</p><p>Let\'s take a look at just the function signature of <code>applyMiddleware</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/79fa2ae4cb62e6594c50193fef69d00b.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The first layer of <code>applyMiddleware</code> takes a list of functions, or middleware, that we\'re going to apply. Here\'s how we might call <code>applyMiddleware</code> in our application.</p><p>In this case we\'re only passing <code>thunk</code> but in another application we may want to pass more. <code>applyMiddleware</code> then returns a new function that takes <code>createStore</code> as it\'s argument. </p><p>This then returns a third function which takes the arguments that we would pass to <code>createStore</code>. In the code sample above, that would be <code>reducer</code> and <code>preloadedState</code>.</p><p>As an aside, the process of returning functions that each require a single argument is called currying. You can read more about that in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/functional-programming-fundamentals/">Functional Programming Fundamentals</a>.</p><p>Okay this third function is now the bulk of <code>applyMiddleware</code>. It has a bound copy of <code>middlewares</code> and <code>createStore</code> and takes whatever arguments we\'re going to pass to <code>createStore</code>.</p><p>Let\'s examine the body of this function, or at least the first half of it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/5c27fe5e7f0ddb7df39052b88eb982ba.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The first thing it does is, surprise, calls <code>createStore</code> with these arguments. Then it temporarily overwrites <code>dispatch</code> to make sure our consumers don\'t accidentally call it while we\'re setting up the store. This pattern should look familiar from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-redux-works/"><a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-redux-works/">part </a>one</a>, we\'re validating before doing business logic.</p><p>Okay now let\'s look at the entire function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/8d79f0ff97192a91bea13f8534aa5b3a.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This function then loops over the list of middleware, which are functions, and calls them with the <code>middlewareAPI</code>. This gives those functions a bound reference to dispatch and <code>getState</code>. It then <code>composes</code> the list of middleware together (more on that later) and gives this new function access to the original <code>dispatch</code> that can only take a plain object.</p><p>Finally, it returns a new object with all the old methods on the store plus this new, wrapped dispatch.</p><h2 id="redux-thunk">Redux Thunk</h2><p>While we\'re composing middleware, this is a great time to take a look at my personal favorite, Redux Thunk.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/4860c96843b35db2438c52767fa230a5.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Wow, thats a dense 14 lines of code, and once again it\'s functions all the way down. Now might be a good time to refresh on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/functional-programming-fundamentals/">currying</a>. Let\'s step through this line by line.</p><p>The first bit is <code>createThunkMiddleware</code>, this function allows us to bind an extra argument to all thunks. This can be used as a way to inject dependencies into all of your action creators at runtime. For example, you might want to only allow API calls from within an action creator. This would let you enforce that.</p><p>You\'ll notice that by default this function exports a thunk middleware with no extra argument. Most people just use thunk without an extra argument.</p><p>Lines 2-8 are the bulk of the logic here. We return a function that takes <code>{dispatch, getState</code>. This is the same <code>middlewareAPI</code> you saw above. So now we have a bound function with <code>dispatch</code>, <code>getState</code>, and maybe an <code>extraArgument</code>.</p><p>Two more functions to go. This returns a function that takes the <code>next</code> middleware to call. This is effectively calling a chain of middlewares until we get to the plain <code>dispatch</code>. Finally, this returns a function that takes an <code>action</code>.</p><p>Lines 3-7 are now the actual <code>thunk</code> logic. If the action is a function, we call it and pass it <code>dispatch</code>, <code>getState</code>, and <code>extraArgument</code>. If it\'s a plain action, we just pass  that on to the next middleware or the original <code>dispatch</code>. </p><p>As an aside, this process is called trampolining in computer science.</p><h1 id="compose">Compose</h1><p>Okay we\'ve now seen <code>applyMiddleware</code> and <code>redux-thunk</code>. Let\'s zero back in on a section of <code>applyMiddleware</code> that should make a little more sense now.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/c8468374cb8a814f9dbf7b7b2cce1436.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This section calls each middleware with the <code>middlewareAPI</code> and then composes that chain together, with a final call to the original <code>store.dispatch</code>. Let\'s take a look at compose.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/e139975425a5f190461c20c6b671650e.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>What\'s this doing? Well compose takes a list of <strong>single argument </strong>functions and passes them to each other from right to left. So <code>compose(f, g, h)</code>would be the same as <code>(...args) =&gt; f(g(h(...args)))</code>.</p><p>You\'ll remember each middleware only takes a single argument at each phase, in this case that\'s <code>next</code>. </p><p>The first 8 lines are just optimizations. If we don\'t have any functions return an identity function and if we only have one function return that.</p><p>This last bit is the intimidating part:</p><p><code>return funcs.reduce((a, b) =&gt; (...args) =&gt; a(b(...args)))</code></p><p>What\'s going on here? Well, it\'s a reduce, another FP paradigm. It loops over <code>funcs</code> and then calls the function given to it with two arguments <code>accumulator</code> and <code>value</code>. In this case <code>a</code> is <code>accumulator</code> and <code>b</code> is <code>value</code>. <code>accumulator</code> is the return value of the previous function call.</p><p>Let\'s say we call <code>compose(f, g, h)</code>. First it loops over the array <code>[f, g, h]</code>. Then this logic happens <code>accumulator = (..args) = &gt; f(..args)</code>. Then we get to <code>g</code> and call <code>accumulator = accumulator(g)</code> or <code>accumulator = (...args) =&gt; f(g(..args))</code>. Finally it gets to <code>h</code> and calls <code>accumulator(h)</code> which is equivalent to <code>accumulator = (...args) =&gt; f(g(h(..args)))</code>.</p><p>If this is difficult to reason follow, don\'t stress. It took me a few hours to wrap my head around it.</p><h1 id="bindactioncreators">bindActionCreators</h1><p>While we\'re on the subject of actions. Let\'s talk about how our actions actually get access to <code>dispatch</code>. If you\'re using <code>react-redux</code> you probably just pass your action creators to <code>mapDispatchToProps</code> and let it take care of things for you. Well under the hood it\'s calling a function called <code>bindActionCreators</code>. Let\'s take a look:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/d10b5bdb1aa3ea0ef0854e29749404e2.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Holy validation batman. Guess what, thats virtually all this function is doing. <code>bindActionCreators</code> either takes a map of action creators or a function that returns one. If it gets a function it just calls the singular <code>bindActionCreator</code> which we\'ll get to.</p><p>Otherwise it does a whole bunch of validation to make sure that our map is in the correct format.</p><p>Assuming that goes well, lines 15-23 loop over the map and create a new map with each function passed to <code>bindActionCreator</code>. Let\'s dig into that inner function now.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/5855b7de59a79fe4f59036bf9d2b10e2.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Were you expecting something other than a closure? <code>bindActionCreator</code> returns an anonymous function that calls the original function <code>actionCreator</code> with whatever arguments the anonymous function got and then passes the result of <code>actionCreator</code> to dispatch. Crazy, huh?</p><h2 id="combinereducers">combineReducers</h2><p>There\'s one file left in <code>src</code> and that\'s <code>combineReducers.js</code>. It\'s a relatively big one, 178 lines, so we\'ll break it down. Much like the rest of redux, there\'s a lot of validation however it only exports one function <code>combineReducers</code>.</p><p>This function takes a map of keys to <code>reducer</code> and returns a new <code>rootReducer</code> that slices up the redux state amongst these keys. The callsite looks like this</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/191b00ffe4f3e2a052f762285bbe6e68.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this case the <code>wizardReducer</code> will receive the slice of the store from the <code>wizard</code> key down and the <code>muggleReducer</code> will receive the slice of the store from the <code>muggle</code> key down.</p><p>Back to the actual redux source, let\'s take a look at the declaration for <code>combineReducers</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/c7239957990bb935ec15f811d369d490.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>These 29 lines are once again validation on our arguments. Redux loops over all the keys, makes sure they\'re all defined and point to a function. Interestingly, if it\'s not a function it doesn\'t bother complaining.</p><p>It also sets up the <code>unexpectedKeyCache</code> which is a reference to any unexpected keys we\'ve warned about. </p><p>It then calls <code>assertReducerShape</code> our first big validation function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/56f2164f455995a358e022491aed7845.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This is a pretty nifty function, it loops over each key and makes sure they handle an <code>INIT</code> action and a randomly generated <code>PROBE_UNKNOWN_ACTION</code> properly. This ensures that all reduces return a <code>defaultState</code> when given no <code>initialState</code> and return <em>something </em>when they get an unknown action.</p><p>Back to <code>combineReducers</code>, after the validation phase it returns our new <code>rootReducer</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/ec4d29d127c357c12e3a66286a3daa94.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But obviously, our <code>rootReducer</code> must do some validation of it\'s own! First off, if <code>assertReducerShape</code> threw an error, it throws that error on every single invocation. It doesn\'t allow us to fail silently here.</p><p>Second, if we\'re in dev mode it calls <code>getUnexpectedStateShapeWarningMessage</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/3c30a9214369f63cc99643e137fc161f.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This is a big function but the bulk of the logic is right here.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/0119aa89e891b33f7c2489d554b5e59d.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Basically, loop over the reducer keys and make sure they\'re identical to the state keys. Also remember any keys we\'ve warned about in the past so we don\'t warn about the same issue repeatedly.</p><p>Finally, we get to the real logic below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/176fa2cd86bc6edc34d4720ac1cf8b5c.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This loop takes every action and passes it to each reducer with the state it previously generated. It then does a simple reference check on each reducer\'s new state. If any of them are different, it returns a new object. Otherwise it just returns the previous state so upstream functions can memoize.</p><p>And that\'s redux! I hope you enjoyed this.</p>',

For part two <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-redux-works-2/">see here</a>.</em></p><h1 id="create-store">Create Store</h1><p>I spend a lot of time walking people through Redux best practices and how to use it, and throughout this process I\'ve found it really helpful to dive into the source itself. While this source is very readable and well commented, I thought I\'d put together a blog post to break it down and add some more context.</p><p>In this article we\'ll be covering <code><a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/src/createStore.js">createStore</a></code>. This is the function that sets up the redux store and provides access to <code>getState</code>, <code>dispatch</code>, <code>subscribe</code>, and <code>replaceReducer</code>. </p><p><em>A note on embedded source: The most up to date redux source is <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/src">available here</a>. I\'ll be embedding source code as of when this post was written.</em></p><h1 id="three-principals">Three Principals</h1><p>Before we get started we should reexamine the <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles">three principals</a> of redux. Below is an excerpt from the redux docs.</p><h3 id="single-source-of-truth">Single source of truth</h3><p>The <a href="https://redux.js.org/glossary#state">state</a> of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single <a href="https://redux.js.org/glossary#store">store</a>.</p><h3 id="state-is-read-only">State is read-only</h3><p>The only way to change the state is to emit an <a href="https://redux.js.org/glossary#action">action</a>, an object describing what happened.</p><h3 id="changes-are-made-with-pure-functions">Changes are made with pure functions</h3><p>To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure <a href="https://redux.js.org/glossary#reducer">reducers</a>.</p><h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3><p>The important bit here is that everything is done with pure functions. As a result of this we prevent consumers from doing things like calling <code>dispatch</code> or <code>getState</code> from within a reducer.</p><p>As we talk about <code>createStore</code> we\'ll notice that the majority of the code enforces these constraints.</p><h1 id="function-signature">Function Signature</h1><p>Now that we\'ve introduced this, let\'s dive into <code>createStore</code>. We\'ll start with the function signature.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/23ad2daace19787621102bf7c04e6d3a.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This takes three arguments <code>reducer</code> <code>preloadedState</code> and <code>enhancer</code>.</p><h2 id="reducer">Reducer</h2><p>The first one is hopefully straightforward. This is the <code>rootReducer</code> for your application. It\'s a pure function that takes a <code>state</code> and an <code>action</code> and returns a new <code>state</code>. It\'s most likely generated by <code><a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/src/combineReducers.js">combineReducers</a></code> which we\'ll cover in part 2.</p><h2 id="preloadedstate">preloadedState</h2><p>This is simply the state you\'d like to start with. Most likely if you\'re using <code>preloadedState</code> you\'re doing one of two things. You have a server side rendered the page, or you have a data payload coming down with your source. Either way you  have data you want loaded into redux as soon as the app is instantiated.</p><p>If you\'re not doing one of these you should probably just dispatch an action after the store is created.</p><h2 id="enhancer">enhancer</h2><p>I sometimes like to call this the <em>enchanter </em>because it really does some magic. The most common uses for this are the <a href="https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension">redux devtools</a> or adding <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/src/applyMiddleware.js">middleware</a>, another thing we\'ll see in part 2.</p><h1 id="argument-validation-and-enhancing">Argument Validation and Enhancing</h1><p>The next lines of code are mostly argument validation. You can read the full source below but here\'s what it\'s doing:</p><ol><li>Ensures you\'ve passed at most three arguments</li><li>Allow the user to only pass <code>reducer</code> and <code>enhancer</code>. If this happens it swaps the argument order.</li><li>Ensures the reducer is an actual function.</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/8268324853199df738b0e3b82670b703.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>There is one <em>very interesting </em>thing going on here though. You can see it on line 22 in the gist above.</p><p><code>enhancer(createStore)(reducer, preloadedState)</code></p><p>If an <code>enhancer</code> function is provided it calls it with <code>createStore</code> as an argument. This function then returns a new <code>createStore</code> function which only takes <code>reducer</code> and <code>preloadedState</code>.</p><p>This pattern is very common in the redux source, wrapping functions in other functions. In fact I like to say it\'s functions all the way down.</p><p>This is also how <a href="https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension">redux devtools</a> works. It wraps the createStore function so it can inject wrappers around every exported function and listen to their inputs and outputs. We won\'t dive too deeply into this, but you can check out <a href="https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/blob/7b0be59e5b28162ca00e99dcd2f092b8df493a47/src/browser/extension/inject/pageScript.js">that source here</a>.</p><h1 id="internal-state">Internal State</h1><p>Before we get to the function declarations, <code>createStore</code> needs to set up some internal state.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/3a6d6b547dfb5b01b5f7b3f7aa1287a6.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Let\'s walk through each of these.</p><ul><li><code>currentReducer</code> - The root reducer redux calls.</li><li><code>currentState</code> - A reference to the key/value object that represents state</li><li><code>currentListeners</code> - This is a list of functions that have subscribed to redux.</li><li><code>nextListeners</code> - This is a reference to the updated listeners before a dispatch.</li><li><code>isDispatching</code> - Effectively a semaphore to block us from dispatching more than one action at a time.</li></ul><p>If these don\'t make total sense yet, especially the latter three, don\'t worry. We\'ll cover these more later.</p><h1 id="function-declarations">Function Declarations</h1><p>We\'re still inside of <code>createStore</code> but now we\'re declaring functions that will be used throughout the lifecycle of the store. Some of these will be returned as part of the store, others will only be used internally. I\'ll label each as we\'re going.</p><h2 id="ensurecanmutatenextlisteners">ensureCanMutateNextListeners</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/acf68892b5ffce759b6c7ff1114c8287.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This function seems inconsequential but it\'s actually very important. Redux supports pub-sub or publish-subscribe. We have no invariants around when a consumer may decide to subscribe to our store or unsubscribe from it. As a result <code>nextListeners</code> needs to be mutable at all times. </p><p>Consider, a listener might even unsubscribe as a result of being called!</p><p>As a result of this we only call listeners in <code>currentListeners</code> and let any new subscriptions modify <code>nextListeners</code>. </p><p>Under the hood, this works because <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice">Array.prototype.slice</a></code> returns a new reference to the list so <code>currentListeners</code> and <code>nextListeners</code> point to different arrays.</p><h2 id="getstate">getState</h2><p>This is a fan favorite, this is the function that returns <code>state</code>. It get\'s returned as part of the store and returns a reference to the current underlying <code>state</code> object.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/73d678df7c701ec3a3478d536d0e46c1.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>You\'ll notice there\'s an invariant here that prevents us from calling this function during a dispatch. There\'s a good reason for this. When reducers are combined they only get a slice of the state, more on that in part 2. We don\'t want a reducer to get access to this function and derive it\'s state from another namespace state tree. As a result this throws if we\'re in the middle of a dispatch.</p><p>You may be thinking, but I call <code>getState</code> from a thunk! We\'re specifically referring to the plain action <code>dispatch</code>, not thunk <code>dispatch</code>. We\'ll cover thunks in part 2.</p><h2 id="subscribe">Subscribe</h2><p>The next function created is <code>subscribe</code>. This is what notifies listeners that something in the store has changed. This function is returned as part of the store.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/91a474355477ea619c32005de42d318a.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Hopefully this pattern is starting to look familiar. Subscribe takes a function that gets called every time the internal <code>state</code> updates. It also does the following validation:</p><ol><li>Make sure the argument is actually a function.</li><li>Make sure we\'re not attaching a subscribe in the middle of a dispatch.</li><li>Make sure we can mutate listeners, otherwise we couldn\'t subscribe!</li></ol><p>It also creates some internal state, <code>isSubscribed</code>. This is used in the <code>unsubscribe</code> function it returns.</p><h2 id="unsubscribe-">Unsubscribe.</h2><p>We\'ve covered how we start listening to things, we call <code>subscribe</code>. But how do we stop? Well <code>subscribe</code> conveniently returns a function called <code>unsubscribe</code> that allows us to stop paying attention to redux.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/3600b8330c4a40417ea3bbc5c874beb1.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This function is very similar to <code>subscribe</code>. It checks <code>isSubscribed</code> (internal state) to see if it\'s already been called, and does some validation to make sure we\'re not currently <code>dispatching</code>. </p><p>Then it removes listener from the list.</p><h2 id="mapstatetoprops">mapStateToProps</h2><p>You might be thinking. I\'ve been using redux for years, I\'ve never called these functions. That\'s because most integration libraries will abstract all this away for us. In the case of the react-redux library this is taken care of in the <code><a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/85fb553ba8e3f4b0efc158d2e48aafb4c18a04d4/src/components/Provider.js">&lt;Provider /&gt;</a></code> component. We won\'t delve too far into that library but you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux">full source here</a>.</p><h1 id="dispatch">Dispatch</h1><p>It\'s worth a reminder that all of this is still being done in the context of the <code>createStore</code> function. The next function is the most important one, <code>dispatch</code>. This is the thing that updates the store and notifies listeners. Let\'s walk through it.</p><h2 id="validation">Validation</h2><p>Like every other function we\'ve encountered. <code>dispatch</code> starts with a bunch of validation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/1d2e71c16f656255bc7edc5d79c5f387.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>You can see above it\'s enforcing the following rules</p><ol><li>We\'re only dispatching a plain object.</li><li>That object has a property called <code>type</code>.</li><li>We are not currently dispatching.</li></ol><p>But once again you might be thinking, but I dispatch functions! This is taken care of by the thunk middleware, something to look forward to in part 2 of this article.</p><h2 id="business-logic">Business Logic</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/dd42acdb76fdeb65f66a5a45be266cac.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that we\'ve made it this far, this function is probably much less impressive than you expected. Here\'s what it\'s doing.</p><ol><li>Set the <code>isDispatching</code> semaphore to <code>true</code></li><li>Call <code>currentReducer</code> with <code>currentState</code> and <code>action</code>.

    content:
      "<p>Higher order components are a useful pattern for creating composable logic within a React application. While they're not as popular as other tools like render props or hooks, they're still worth knowing.</p><p>How do higher order components work? Well as we discussed in <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/functional-programming-fundamentals/\">Functional Programming Fundamentals</a>, higher order functions take a function as an argument and/or returns an argument as it's result.</p><p>In this case, higher order components are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new supercharged component as a result. This poses an interesting problem for typing.</p><p>We want to expose a component that only needs require the props <em>not</em> provided by the HOC, but we still want to be able to access the original uncomposed component.</p><p>Let's walk through an example.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/343b3bb2726bb1b63c80406ecca419c8.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We start with a super basic component, <code>TomRiddle</code>. Now it matters not what someone is born, but what they chose to be. <code>TomRiddle</code> takes an <code>isEvil</code> prop that determines if it renders \"Tom Marvolo Riddle\" or \"I am Lord Voldemort\".</p><p>Tom isn't such a great guy and wants to learn how to make horcruxes. How do we teach him? Well we could make him into a class component and add some state. Let's see what that looks like.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/1fa3633692b86a5be34229777d0cae1d.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This totally works. We've taught Tom how to make horcruxes. Now Tom wants to recruit some followers, he calls those Death Eaters. Let's add another prop for those. While we're at it, let's derive <code>isEvil</code>  from the number of horcruxes the wizard has. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/008edec62ba9f1a661910071327e554e.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now this component is doing a bit too much. It's rendering to the DOM and it's managing state. Also, anyone can learn to make horcruxes, what if we take that functionality and make it into a higher order component. </p><p>Before we get to typing this, let's take a look at what this would look like in vanilla JS.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/9f09e9aed1cc76125902ddbf58e1ad37.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><code>EvilWizard</code> is a function that takes a component, <code>Wizard</code>, and passes that component the following props <code>numHorcruxes</code>, and <code>makeHorcrux</code>. It also manages this state for them.</p><p>Now, two minor gotchas with HOCs, we need to set the <code>displayName</code> and <code>hoistNonReactStatics</code>.</p><p>Okay now let's type this thing. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/984fd1a6f9473dca0bb9004ee66b5438.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>What's going on here? A lot actually. Let's break it down. We export a type called <code>WithEvilWizardProps</code>. This type takes <code>T</code>, a generic, and returns an intersection type of <code>T</code> and <code>EvilWizardInnerProps</code>.</p><p>The function <code>EvilWizard</code> takes a <code>Wizard</code> that is either a <code>ComponentClass</code> or a <code>FunctionComponent</code>. The props of this component is of type <code>EvilWizardInnerProps &amp; T</code>. Now here's the real magic. The component we're returning is a class of type <code>React.ComponentClass&lt;T&gt;</code>. </p><p>What does this mean? Well because we're using an intersection type, Typescript is smart enough to unpack this and return a component that only requires the props <strong>not</strong> provided by the HOC.</p><p>One last thing, let's update <code>TomRiddle</code> to use this new HOC.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/12e3e8ed7234df320490df373841a091.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We've now extracted all that state back out and we're using <code>WithEvilWizardProps</code> when declaring <code>TomRiddleProps</code>. Now let's use our components!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/f63c4028e796863f55f991bb815b5ce0.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As you can see above, we have the option of using <code>LordVoldemort</code> the output of <code>EvilWizard(TomRiddle)</code> or we can just call <code>TomRiddle</code> directly. This is particularly useful if you want to test the behavior of the inner component without the HOC.</p>",

      "<p>If you enjoyed my post on <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ts-tricks-type-guards/\">type guards</a>, this one might tickle your fancy. We're going to talk about how to build a type-safe reducer. Now, I use these for redux reducers, but these principles could apply to any function.</p><p>Let's start by typing some actions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/e44f3e0a9181aa543480a23b0c18409b.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>You'll notice we've created two action types <code>MakeFriend</code> and <code>LearnSpell</code>. Each of these has a <code>type</code> and a <code>payload</code>. The <code>payload</code> of each however is a different shape. In this case it's an object with a single key, but you can imagine a much more complex scenario.</p><p>Now at the bottom we have a type called <code>WizardActions</code>. This is what's called a <em>discriminated union. </em>What this means is that we can take an argument of type <code>WizardActions</code> and it will be exactly <em>one</em> the types in the union. Let's look at some more code to elaborate.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/075e46c391c59d48b1ee8dc6977c9606.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We now have a reducer that takes a <code>state</code> and an <code>action</code> and returns the current state. Don't worry, we'll handle these actions later. Now the <code>action</code> argument is of type <code>WizardActions</code> which means it's going to be of type <code>MakeFriend</code> or of type <code>LearnSpell</code>.</p><p>Let's expand on our reducer and keep going.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/bfc303ff9ca54f1bdaba392a1e2d470b.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If you're used to redux, this should look familiar. We have a switch statement on the action type and we're handling each payload differently. For <code>MakeFriend</code> actions we append a friend to the list of friends. For <code>LearnSpell</code> actions we append a spell to the list of spells.</p><p>We actually don't need the default case because this is an exhaustive type-check, but it's still good to be defensive in case someone upstream uses an <code>any</code>. It's also necessary if we integrate this with redux.</p><p>How does this work? Well Typescript is pretty smart. It figures out on it's own that checking <code>type</code> will guarantee the payload is a certain shape. When we go to access that payload, it knows what properties to expect. If we attempted to check the <code>spell</code> of a <code>MakeFriend</code> action we would get a type error.</p><p>Let's have some fun now and call our reducer. First let's make some friends.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/a3829b4e82aa81ba62bf73c6fcda7c26.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This reducer works how we expect at runtime; Harry meets Ron, then he meets Hermione.

It explicitly finds a DOM node and updates it. While this is fine for such a simple example this won\'t scale well. What happens when we want multiple counters in multiple locations? React is ready for that, with vanilla JS we have a lot of work to do.</p><p>Now it\'s worth noting that declarative code will always end up either compiling down to or being processed by something imperative. What do I mean by that? Well <em>something</em> has to do the DOM mutation. In this case that\'s React. Even with functional languages like Lisp or Haskell they <em>eventually</em> get compiled to imperative machine code.</p><h2 id="example">Example</h2><h3 id="imperative">Imperative</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/9fc233a7e7dcd880912a25f5fec938c0.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="declarative">Declarative</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/f4b604ff5b55acda3300866195d4d0bf.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now these two functions achieve the exact same thing. They take a list of <code>files</code> and return a dictionary of files where the key is <code>file.id</code>.</p><p>But the imperative one is sloppier. It\'s 8 lines of code instead of 3. It also leaves a lot of room for error.</p><p>What happens if a file doesn\'t have an <code>id</code>? What happens if we get our exit clause wrong? And fun fact, there are faster ways to do for loops (they\'re ugly), but we can trust lodash to do those under the hood.</p><hr><h1 id="functional-concepts">Functional Concepts</h1><p>It\'s now time to move onto functional concepts. Let\'s take these in pairs, the first two <strong>separation </strong>and <strong>composition.</strong></p><h2 id="separation">Separation</h2><blockquote><em>If you try to perform effects and logic at the same time, you may create hidden side effects which cause bugs in the logic. Keep functions small. Do one thing at a time, and do it well. </em><a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-dao-of-immutability-9f91a70c88cd" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><em>[4]</em></a></blockquote><h2 id="composition">Composition</h2><blockquote><em>Plan for composition. Write functions whose outputs will naturally work as inputs to many other functions. Keep function signatures as simple as possible. </em><a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-dao-of-immutability-9f91a70c88cd" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><em>[4]</em></a></blockquote><p>I pulled these quotes from an article called <em><a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-dao-of-immutability-9f91a70c88cd">The Dao of Immutability</a>. </em>What we\'re saying here is we want small functions that easily chain together to make larger ones. Let\'s take a look at an example:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/cb7622935829a6ce49badfdc1af3974e.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>These three functions are all super simple. They take one argument and do a transformation on that argument. The first function sorts the list of files.</p><p>The second function is a <code>filter</code>.  <code>filter</code> is an FP term for filtering in, as opposed to filtering out. So this code returning an array of files who\'s extensions are PDFs.</p><p>The last function is just a <code>map</code>. <code>map</code> is another FP term, a 1:1 transformation over a list to a new version of that list. In this case we\'re looping over the list of files and returning the key <code>name</code> from each of them.</p><p>Now we can combine them together:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/e49ca9b4e211c8eda34ea078ee88645f.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now both of these functions are equivalent. They take a list of files, filter for pdfs, get their names, and return a sorted list of file names.</p><p><code>lodash.flow</code> does have some optimizations under the hood, but the second syntax might be more readable to you. Do whatever you think is best.</p><p>Let\'s move on to the next set of concepts.</p><h2 id="immutability">Immutability</h2><blockquote><em>The true constant is change. Mutation hides change. Hidden change manifests chaos. Therefore, the wise embrace history. </em><a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-dao-of-immutability-9f91a70c88cd" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><em>[4]</em></a></blockquote><h2 id="memoization">Memoization</h2><blockquote><em>Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><em>[5]</em></a></blockquote><p>These pair really nicely. Immutability says we\'re never gonna mutate an argument only return a new one, and memoization allows us to remember outputs. Let\'s look at an example combining them.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/47fe2834b2da7bab88c705095db096de.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>What\'s going on here? Well we have a function called <code>killSibling</code> (dark I know), that takes a wizard. It copies over the wizard and decrements the number of siblings that wizard has. Please ignore any glaring bugs here, I wanted to keep this simple.</p><p>We then pass <code>killSibling</code> to <code>lodash.memoize</code>, this produces a new function called <code>killSiblingMemoized</code>. Now when we call <code>killSiblingMemoized</code> on <code>ron</code>, it returns a brand new object. If we do a strict equality check it returns false. Of course it does, his brother died, he\'s a different person now.</p><p>Because we\'ve memoized this, if we repeat this call to <code>killSiblingMemoized</code> we\'ll get the exact same version of <code>ron</code> we got after the first call.</p><p>We\'ve covered a lot, now let\'s move onto some advanced topics.</p><hr><h1 id="higher-order-functions">Higher Order Functions</h1><p>In mathematics and computer science, a <strong>higher-order function </strong>is a function that does at least one of the following:</p><ul><li>takes one or more functions as arguments(i.e.,procedural parameters),</li><li>returns a function as its result. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">[6]</a></li></ul><p>This seems much more intimidating than it actually is.

    content:
      '<h1 id="before-we-get-started">Before We Get Started</h1><p>This article assumes a working knowledge of Redux, React, React-Redux, TypeScript, and uses a little bit of Lodash for convenience. If you’re not familiar with those subjects, you might need to do some Googling. You can find the final version of all the code <a href="https://github.com/matthew-gerstman/redux-codesplit-typechecl-example/tree/master" rel="noopener">here</a>. Also, follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewgerstman" rel="noopener">@MatthewGerstman.</a></p><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1><p>Redux has become the go-to state management system for React applications. While plenty of material exists about Redux best practices in Single Page Applications (SPAs), there isn’t a lot of material on putting together a store for a large, monolithic application.</p><p>What happens when you only need a few reducers on each page, but it could be any permutation of the total number of reducers you support? How do you code-split your store so you’re not serving unnecessary JavaScript on a single page? And while you’re working on code splitting, how do you get it to play nicely with TypeScript so that you can trust what’s going in and coming out of the store?</p><h1 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h1><p>Before we dive into code, let’s outline the architecture we’re about to build.</p><p><strong>We need to create the store in such a way that we can register reducers asynchronously. </strong>This allows us to async load code associated with those reducers.</p><p><strong>We need to type the store in such a way that it knows about all possible reducers we can register. </strong>This allows us to ensure static typing of all components at runtime.</p><h1 id="creating-the-store">Creating the Store</h1><p>In order to code split, we need to instantiate the store in a way that allows us to register reducers after store creation. We start with the following code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/2094e725ecbda01342b8ec973f240f58.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>What’s going on here? We’re instantiating the store with the file and we’ve also exported two functions. One called <code>getStore</code>, which is simply a wrapper around the store and doesn’t need much further explanation, and <code>registerReducer</code>.</p><p><code>registerReducer</code> is the more interesting function. We maintain a map of existing reducers internal to the module and then replace add new ones as they come in. We then call <code><a href="https://redux.js.org/api/store#replaceReducer" rel="noopener">replaceReducer</a></code> on the store and replace it wholesale. <code><a href="https://redux.js.org/api/store#replaceReducer" rel="noopener">replaceReducer</a></code> is smart enough to maintain the state of the reducers that were previously there and fires an <code>INIT</code> action for the new ones to populate their default state.</p><p>This is what makes code-splitting possible. We don’t care when the reducer is registered and all of that code can be loaded after the store is created.</p><h1 id="type-safety">Type Safety</h1><p>Now let’s dig into what makes this type safe. Well, let’s dig into our <code>types.ts</code> file.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/cacb21238ab545930a86b68aec0d9b71.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You’ll notice we import <code>MuggleNamespaceShape</code> and <code>WizardNamespaceShape</code>from elsewhere in the codebase. This is okay. Because these are type-only imports, most build systems won’t actually bundle them in when building packages. This is where the statically typed code splitting magic happens.</p><p>We then export types <code>StoreShape</code> and <code>ReducerMap</code>, which allow us to register all possible types on the actual state object in advance. Because we colocate the namespace keys in the types file, our developers can ensure that there are no key conflicts.</p><p>You’ll notice these types are both <code>Partial</code>, so how do we enforce that a reducer is actually registered? Well, we do that in the selector layer.</p><h1 id="selectors">Selectors</h1><p>Our selector layer is what ensures that we always have the reducers registered that we need. We can do this with a simple helper function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/0f5d8c39386d508f53cf4d27fd140619.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In short, <code>getStateAtNamespaceKey</code> complains <strong>very loudly </strong>if you attempt to access a namespace that hasn’t been registered yet. This is the only way we should access our data. As long as you call <code>registerReducer</code> in the same part of your tree as your <code><a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#provider-store" rel="noopener">&lt;Provider /&gt;</a></code> component, your namespace should be registered by the time you get down to a <code><a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options]" rel="noopener">connect</a></code>. We’ll elaborate on this in a moment.</p><h1 id="writing-actual-product-code">Writing Actual Product Code</h1><p>This is is all well and good, but let’s talk about what our product code looks like.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/39db0e7769d346bddf35d34f02e72770.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The code above is (hopefully) straightforward. We connect to the Redux store using <code>react-redux</code>and use the <code><a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#provider-store" rel="noopener">&lt;Provider /</a>&gt;</code>and <code><a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options" rel="noopener">connect</a></code>component/HOC respectively. We take a list of wizards and render them out to the screen, along with information about what spells they know and the status of their parents. Spoiler: We’re getting to a certain boy wizard with a lightning scar.</p><p>The two novel bits of code here are <code>getStoreForWizardApp</code>and <code>getWizards</code>. Let’s dig into them both.</p><h2 id="getstoreforwizardapp">getStoreForWizardApp</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/fc3befd0a3e2230d0915bdeb44f00f61.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In the above code, you saw what we call the <code>registerReducer</code>and <code>getStore</code>functions that we declared before. We pass <code>registerReducer</code>a map with the key for the Wizard namespace and the Wizard reducer. Another important note: if we try to pass the wrong key or even the wrong reducer to <code>registerReducer</code>, type checking will complain about it.</p><p>One last but crucial bit. We wrap <code>getStoreForWizardApp</code> in <code><a href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#once" rel="noopener">lodash.once</a></code>. This ensures that we only register the reducer once and then always return the same instance of the store. While this isn’t <em>strictly</em>required, <code>replaceReducer</code>is an expensive noop, if called repeatedly.</p><h2 id="getwizards">getWizards</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/fe22e16974ae0c706b085c33ae44ab65.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This one is much more straightforward. We call <code>getStateAtNamespaceKey</code>and spit out the wizards to the user.</p><h2 id="actions">Actions</h2><p>Sweet! We’ve set up the store, registered our reducer, and even built some components. Now let’s talk about how we can strongly type our actions. We do this in both the action layer and the reducer layer.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/4ce621d79bf0b86a31d9174634d89a47.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>You’ll notice that we have two action types: <code>LearnSpellAction</code>and <code>KillParentsAction</code>. These actions each have a strongly-typed payload and their type is a predetermined string enum. We also export <code>WizardAction</code>, which is useful in our reducer.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/7447b9ae50d93c4f6123a970bcb170b3.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This is one of those occasions where TypeScript is truly brilliant. Our given action type is any of the <code>WizardActionTypes</code>. Because each of them has their own defined <code>type</code>property, our switch statement will actually strongly type <code>action.payload</code>after we determine its type. If we were to put any invalid code here, TypeScript would complain.</p><h2 id="store-hydration">Store Hydration</h2><p>The last question to answer here is: “How do we get initial data into the store?” That’s done through a process called store hydration. What this means is that we’re going to dispatch an action that sets the state. Let’s take a look at this code.</p><p>First, we update our <code>actions.ts</code>file as shown.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/81a26bbfbe2ffd616dd7a836ef2c3198.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Second, we add another switch statement to our reducer.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/74cb2c46fabadca1a7d8d5be996aada8.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Third, we need to make an action creator.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/e544e1e35f1e88c6c011a832910479a4.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Finally, we dispatch the hydration action from our store creation function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/97162d4992692dd6daa90bc6f0ed3d93.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The <code><a href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#once" rel="noopener">lodash.once</a></code>is now extra useful because we will only ever populate the store once.</p><h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1><p>I hope this article helped you get started with Redux. At compile time, our store is strongly typed and has knowledge of the entire system. At runtime, we can code split however we’d like.</p><h1 id="glossary-of-functions">Glossary of Functions</h1><p>This is a list of the core functions and types and the roles they serve in this architecture.</p><h2 id="types">Types</h2><ul><li><strong>NamespaceKey </strong>— A key for a reducer or namespace within the state object.</li><li><strong>ReducerMap </strong>— Object of all possible keys we can have on our store and their matching reducers.

On Broadway, off Broadway, everything from tiny one-person shows to Hamilton in London. If the show has something that looks like a Playbill I\'ll probably get around to seeing it.

    content:
      '<p>You\'ve done it, you\'ve built your first web application. It does everything you expect. You\'ve tested it rigorously. It works everywhere, your Macbook, your iPhone, your friend\'s android. You\'re so proud of yourself, you send it to your parents; they tell you it\'s just a blank page.</p><p>You poke around and realize they\'re still using that Dell desktop they bought in 2006. It\'s running Windows 7. They\'re using Internet Explorer 10. Your web-app doesn\'t work on this machine.</p><p>So you Google how to make your app work in IE 10, or 11, or whatever. You\'re quickly flooded with acronyms and terms you\'ve never heard before ES5, ES6, ESNext, ES2020, TC39, ECMA. What\'s a transpiler? People are debating about polyfills and ponyfills; is there a difference?</p><p>If you\'re overwhelmed, that\'s okay, it\'s a lot. This article will attempt to cover the entire ecosystem around shipping new-ish JavaScript to older browsers and how the community decides what features get added to JavaScript in the first place; let\'s dive in.</p><h1 id="let-s-talk-about-ecma">Let\'s Talk About ECMA</h1><p>ECMA is the European Computer Manufacturers Association. They have many committees that handle many things. One of these committees is TC39 or Technical Committee 39. They maintain a specification, or spec, called ECMAScript. Whenever you hear ES5, ES6, or ESAnything, the ES refers to ECMAScript.</p><p>ECMAScript is the spec which JavaScript is built upon. It\'s a formal in-writing agreement of how JavaScript should work. Each browser has their own implementation of JavaScript but they all conform to the same spec (or they do their best). This is why your code may run slightly differently in Safari or Firefox or Chrome. The browser vendors are implementing an engine that takes your JavaScript and runs it on the machine.</p><h2 id="es5-es6-esnext">ES5, ES6, ESNext</h2><p>Now, this underlying spec is constantly changing. JavaScript gets new features and browsers evolve. In 2009, ES5 was standardized across browsers. This was the largest release for a long time. If you\'ve ever read <a href="https://amzn.to/2MWOggZ">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> it was based on ES5. </p><p>It wasn\'t until 2015 that ES6 was released with major changes to the language. Some of the bigger features in ES6 included Promises, Arrow Functions, and Classes.</p><p>ES6 was a massive release. It was so big, and took so long, that TC39 decided to stop numbering ECMAScript altogether. At this point they decided to rebrand ES6 as ES2015 and brand all future versions by year. Examples include ES2016, ES2017, etc.</p><p>They also introduced the concept of ESNext, a living breathing version of the latest JavaScript. ESNext includes all the features that have been formally agreed upon by the committee.</p><h3 id="a-note-on-es6">A Note On ES6</h3><p>You may be thinking: I thought ES6 was the latest version of JavaScript. This is a misnomer. For a number of reasons, people often refer to anything after ES5 as ES6. This is mostly due to the fact that ES6 was a very large release, and the last one to have a simple version number.</p><p>If you hear someone say ES6, they likely mean ESNext.</p><h2 id="tc39">TC39</h2><p>Technical Committee 39 meet semi-regularly, usually on the West Coast of the United States, but sometimes elsewhere. You can see all their meeting agendas <a href="https://github.com/tc39/agendas">here</a>. They\'re made up of individuals from major tech companies who are members of ECMA. For most large companies, for example Google or Facebook, it costs about $70,000 for membership. There are significant discounts for very small or non-profit companies. You can see the full list of members <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/members.htm">here</a>.</p><h2 id="new-javascript-features">New JavaScript Features</h2><p>Anybody can submit a proposal for a new JavaScript feature, but every proposal eventually needs a "champion" from the committee in order to be adopted. Proposals are submitted by opening a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals">proposals repo</a>.</p><p>Features go through stages from 0 to 4. At the end of the year, all features in Stage 4 are considered in that year\'s version of ECMAScript. You can see the full list of finished proposals <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md">here</a>.</p><h3 id="stage-0-strawperson">Stage 0: Strawperson</h3><p>These are strawperson proposals. This is the idea stage. The only requirement to get to Stage 0 is the initial PR.</p><h3 id="stage-1-proposal">Stage 1: Proposal</h3><p>This is the stage where the committee agrees they will spend time discussing on the feature. They assign a champion to the proposal, determine the high level API, and potentially implement a demo. It is expected that a feature will spend a good chunk of time being worked on in Stage 1 before reaching Stage 2.</p><h3 id="stage-2-draft">Stage 2: Draft</h3><p>At this point, a there should be a formal specification for the feature. It may still have lots of TODOs and room for improvement, but it\'s mostly there. If a significant issue is discovered, the feature may have to go back to Stage 1.</p><h3 id="stage-3-candidate">Stage 3: Candidate</h3><p>This is when the feature is mostly complete. The committee agrees that they are unable to find any issues until someone attempts to implement the feature. If a browser vendor attempts to implement the feature and finds an issue, the feature may go back to Stage 2.</p><h3 id="stage-4-finished">Stage 4: Finished</h3><p>A feature is considered done when it\'s been implemented in not one, but two different browsers. For example, if a feature becomes stable in both Firefox and Chrome, it\'s considered finished. The committee will then merge in a pull request to the ECMAScript spec.</p><p>The full ECMAScript spec is available <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/">here</a>.</p><h1 id="running-your-code">Running Your Code</h1><p>We often want to use the latest features in our code, but older browsers won\'t support them. To do this, we use transpilers and polyfills.</p><h2 id="transpilers">Transpilers</h2><p>A transpiler is a type of compiler that takes source code written in a high level language and produces equivalent source code in another high level language. This is in contrast to a compiler, which takes source code written in a high level language and compiles it to a low level language like assembly.</p><p>Transpilers can also be used to convert from one version of a language to another one. This is how we can write JavaScript using the newest features but still execute our code in browsers that don\'t support them natively.</p><p>For example we can compile an arrow function to a traditional one.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const func = () =&gt; {\n  console.log(\'foo\');\n}\n\nconst func = function () {\n  console.log(\'foo\');\n}\n</code></pre><h3 id="babel">Babel</h3><p>One of the most popular transpilers is <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel</a>. Babel is the go-to test environment for early JavaScript features. It does this by implementing a rich plugin architecture that allows developers to test syntax while it is still in it\'s earliest stages.</p><h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3><p>TypeScript goes a step further and adds type-checking to JavaScript. As part of this, it offers a built in transpiler to build your ESNext code for older browsers. While Babel has the ecosystem to support Stage 2 and below features, Typescript does not.</p><p>Sometimes developers will chose to use both so they can get type-checking and the latest features.</p><h3 id="targets">Targets</h3><p>When building our code we\'ll pick a target version of JavaScript. This is most commonly ES5 however we could compile to any arbitrary version of the ECMAScript spec. The tradeoff is that older targets generate more source code, but newer targets will run in fewer browsers.</p><p>The reason we often want to generate less source is performance. Fewer bytes means less to send over the network, less to parse, and less to execute.</p><h2 id="polyfills">Polyfills</h2><p>Transpiling is enough for syntax changes, but what about new functions and classes? That\'s where polyfills come in. A polyfill is the implementation of a newer feature written in an older version of ES. The polyfill usually check if the browser has it\'s own version of the feature and if not inject it.</p><p>For example a fetch polyfill might look like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">if (window.fetch === undefined) {\n  window.fetch = function() {\n   // Implementation of fetch here\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Babel and Typescript will support a configuration to automatically include any necessary polyfills in your source code.</p><p>Under the hood, most most polyfills rely on a project called <a href="https://github.com/zloirock/core-js">core-js</a>.</p><h3 id="ponyfill">Ponyfill</h3><p>While polyfills automatically inject an implementation of the feature, ponyfills will treat them as any other dependency. There are a few advantages to this. Ponyfills don\'t polute the global scope. In addition, the implementation of a feature may vary between browsers and the polyfill. This allows engineers to use a consistent implementation of a feature.</p><p>For example a fetch ponyfill might look like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const fetch = window.fetch || require(\'fetch-ponyfill\');\n</code></pre><p>It is commonly debated which approach is better. I\'ll leave that exercise up to the reader.</p><h2 id="where-you-run-your-code-matters">Where You Run Your Code Matters</h2><p>When deciding what version of ES to target and what polyfills to include, it\'s important to consider where your code is running.</p><p>We often focus on which browsers and which versions of those browsers we support, but JavaScript can run many places. For example, if you\'re building an Electron application, you may not need to transpile/polyfill at all. The same thing applies to node applications. If you\'re building for one specific environment, you only need to worry about how your code runs in that environment.</p><h1 id="thanks">Thanks</h1><p>I hope this post was useful!

This is exceptionally useful when I\'m pacing between my office and the kitchen during the work day.</p><p>Most of the panels were available out of the box, but I had to roll my own <a href="http://github.com/matthew-gerstman/tweetonescreen">tweet visualizer</a> in the lower left hand corner.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-app-2.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667"><figcaption>Entryway Dakboard</figcaption></figure><p>I also have <a href="https://amzn.to/3pWhdxm">Eufy Pan and Tilt cameras</a> here and in every other room so I can watch the cats or check on the apartment when I\'m out of town. </p><h2 id="the-bedroom">The Bedroom</h2><p>In the the bedroom I took things up a notch with <a href="https://amzn.to/3324wYS">White Ambiance</a> bulbs. I like these because the temperature is warmer at night and easier on the eyes. The television is connected to an Apple TV with two HomePod Classics in a stereo pair. I connected my vintage turntable to the Homepods with <a href="https://amzn.to/3zshGuH">this adapter</a>, a <a href="https://amzn.to/3pSkOfY">Behringer USB preamp</a> and <a href="https://www.airchordapp.com">AirChord</a> running on my old iPad.</p><p>There are a pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/3sYnMkX">Philips Hue Edison Bulbs</a> in <a href="https://amzn.to/3pUGDvC">these lamps</a>. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/smart-home-device-7.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500"><figcaption>Bedroom</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/smart-home-device-8.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500"><figcaption>Bedroom Media</figcaption></figure><h1 id="scenes">Scenes</h1><p>All this integration means I can do a lot of nifty things with scenes. First, theres some simple automation. The couch lamps and the steel lamp both turn off at 5 PM every day. The bedroom shade automatically lifts at 7:30 AM on weekdays which abruptly informs the cats its time to wake me up.</p><p>The AC is controlled with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3FV8AZv">Sensibo Air</a> to make the window units smart.</p><p>The scenes I use every day are Good Morning and Good Night. Good Morning opens every shade, turns on every light to 100%, and boots the entryway TV up. Good Night turns off every light. There\'s another scene: Make it Dark, that turns off every light and closes every shade. </p><p>Each room has a <a href="https://amzn.to/31oY8dQ">hue dimmer switch</a> that controls the whole room. I made two scenes for each room, Room One and Room Zero. Those turn off every light and control the shades. In between those I have scenes that brings an assorted set of lights on. For example in the kitchen I have a scene that only turns on the countertop lights.</p><p>My favorite scene is Lullaby which turns off my TV, closes my shades, and begins playing a playlist in the bedroom currently composed of The Postal Service, Taylor Swift, The Postal Service again, and Billie Eilish. There\'s also Nap Time which does all this and turns off the bedroom lights.</p><p>In the same vein, Nightlight turns on a dim light in the master bathroom, kitchen, and living room. </p><p>For anything Marvel, I put on TV Time which closes the shades and turns off any light that I can see from the Living Room, including the entryway TV. It\'s counterspell is Chill, which opens all shades and turns every light in the apartment to 50%. I used <a href="http://leviosashades.com">Leviosa Shades</a> which integrate with HomeKit, although I wish the bridge was more reliable.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-automation-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1397"><figcaption>Home App Screenshot</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-automation-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1397"><figcaption>Home App Screenshot - Bedroom</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-automation-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1397"><figcaption>Home App Screenshot - Kitchen</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-automation-4.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1397"><figcaption>Home App Screenshot - Living Room</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-automation-5.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1397"><figcaption>Home App Screenshot - Office</figcaption></figure><h1 id="speakers-and-music">Speakers and Music</h1><p>I\'ve already touched on the speakers but I\'ll reiterate and be a bit more thorough this time. The Office has a paired set of HomePod mini\'s that I use with the computers. The bookshelf has a <a href="https://amzn.to/31tr0lo">Sonos Five</a> connected to a <a href="https://amzn.to/3mZjuGj">Fluance RT85</a> turntable for vinyl. This can stream vinyl throughout the entire apartment.</p><p>The Bedroom has a pair of HomePod Classics for primary listening. The turntable is a vintage Sanyo with an <a href="https://amzn.to/331ORsA">Ortofon Blue cartridge</a>. I like to read and listen to records on this setup. I occasionally put the <a href="https://amzn.to/3pSzN9K">Sonos roam</a> in here if I\'m doing a project where I\'m running between rooms and want to listen to vinyl.</p><p>I\'ve also got one of two iPod displays in the Bedroom. I love iPods, they were iconic during my formative years and are a form of Apple Nostalgia for me. The iPod Mini display includes one of each color with a different artist on each. They are from left to right Green Day, Taylor Swift, Coldplay, Blink 182, and Frank Turner. They also work! I stream them to an old Zenith radio using an iTrip.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-device-setup.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667"><figcaption>iPod Mini Display</figcaption></figure><p>The Living Room is where the magic happens. The main system is a <a href="https://amzn.to/3pQ0j3z">Sonos Arc</a>, two rear <a href="https://amzn.to/3EUDxMl">Sonos One SLs</a>, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/3zr4PIT">Sonos Sub</a>. This sounds fantastic for movies and is also a great party system.</p><p>To the right I have the iPod Classic display. This contains each generation of iPod and the first five generations of iPhone. All of these devices work and are loaded with content.</p><p>There\'s also an iPod Hi-Fi that can accept any of the iPods with dock connectors and play their music. Inside the box is an Airport Express to pair this speaker to AirPlay 2. I mostly use this speaker when I\'m working out in the landing strip between the carpet and the display or when I\'m drunk and feel like dancing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/smart-home-device-9.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500"><figcaption>Photo Wall With iPod Display</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, there\'s a HomePod mini tucked away in the back that I exclusively use for Siri.</p><h1 id="legacy-macs">Legacy Macs</h1><p>Behind the couch is my legacy mac setup. There\'s a few machines here. There\'s a 2014 Macbook Pro I use to manage all of my devices. A 2009 Macbook Pro I use to manage some legacy iPads. and my favorite, a 2007 Black Macbook that\'s dual booting Snow Leopard and Windows XP.</p><p>These are mostly toys, but they all work and I use them for projects.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-app-3.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500"><figcaption>2007 Macbook running WIndows XP</figcaption></figure><h1 id="bugs">Bugs</h1><p>I\'m really proud of this thing I built, but it definitely has it\'s quirks. The various bridges all need to be reset from time to time, and I once just turned off the circuit breaker to turn off everything at once and reboot the whole apartment. Recently, I added a <a href="https://amzn.to/3HvAuvy">smart power switch</a> so I could power cycle the bridges from my phone. The Pi-hole DNS is one of the most likely things to crash so I have that plugged into it as well.</p><p>Scenes featuring music are particularly unreliable. Lullaby and Nightlight will work for a while and then stop. I used to have a scene called Tunes that would play a playlist on every speaker in the house, but I gave up after too many failures.</p><p>There\'s also an issue where the living room AppleTV is slightly out of sync with other AirPlay devices. I work around this by unplugging the Sonos Arc and airplaying directly to it when I want to use multiple speakers at once.</p><p>Another issue is Siri always feels the need to tell me when one or more devices didn\'t respond. This is great in theory, but is almost never useful. I consistently repeat the request and it works the second time. It also doesn\'t give me any insight into which device failed. Many of my scenes are controlling 30+ accessories so I have no way of knowing if a bridge is down or the bathroom light is just off. It\'d be nice if the home app gave me this info.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/all-in-on-homekit/homekit-automation-6.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1397"><figcaption>Home App Screenshot - Misc</figcaption></figure><p></p><h1 id="wrap-up-and-feature-requests">Wrap Up and Feature Requests</h1><p>The main tools I used to make this apartment smart were Philips Hue bulbs and fixtures, Apple devices, the Leviosa Shades, and a bunch of VOCOLinc adapters. From there it was a massive time investment to get everything working the way I wanted it to.</p><p>Scenes are a small nightmare to compose. Any time I add or move I light I need to modify every single scene it\'s in. I would love to see composable scenes where I can say "this is the office in chill mode" or "this is the bedroom 100%". This way I could make Good Morning the composition of Bedroom One, Living Room One, and Office One.</p><p>I would also love a guest mode. Whenever I have someone visiting I need to be careful with apartment-wide scenes while they\'re sleeping. It would be great if I could just make a room automonmous for a period.</p><p>The home app is overdue for a makeover. It was perfect when I lived in a 350 sqft studio apartment, but now that I have multiple rooms, many accessories, and many scenes it\'s unweildy and unreliable. I\'m hoping that Apple improves this in a future release.</p><p>Overall though, I\'m happy I went with HomeKit. It integrates with everything else I own and Apple\'s track record on privacy is next to none. I really hope Apple improves the stability of HomeKit and HomePods over the next few years, but until then I\'ll keep tinkering.</p>',

This is most commonly a list, but really it\'s any object that can be mapped over.</p><p>For example, we can make a <code>Wizard</code> that can be mapped over.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/4f20482a242e565ea455ebb78f0a617a.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>Note: in most practical situations, a functor would be parametric (containing a type parameter like <code>String</code> in <code>Array&lt;String&gt;</code>), but <code>Wizard</code> does fulfill the basic definition of a functor.</em></p><p>Now the <code>map</code> function also needs to meet the following criteria.</p><h2 id="identity-law-1-">Identity Law  <a href="https://medium.com/@dtinth/what-is-a-functor-dcf510b098b6">[1]</a></h2><p>If map is given an identity function it must return the exact same object. Like so:</p><p><code>functor.map(x =&gt; x) === functor</code></p><p>This one is hopefully straightforward.</p><h2 id="composition-law-1-">Composition Law  <a href="https://medium.com/@dtinth/what-is-a-functor-dcf510b098b6">[1]</a></h2><p><code>functor.map(x =&gt; f(g(x))) === functor.map(g).map(f)</code></p><p>Woah that\'s intimidating. What does this actually mean? Let\'s look at an example.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/a9a6c8392e87e7a936a3e383fa0f2be5.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We have <code>joinGryffindor</code> and <code>learnExpelliarmous</code>. If we call </p><p><code>wizard.map(joinGryffindor).map(learnExpelliarmous)</code> it needs to be equivalent to  <code>wizard.map(w =&gt; learnExpelliarmous(joinGryffindor(w)))</code>. </p><p>Now it\'s worth calling out, it needs to be functionally equivalent. In abstract mathematics we\'re not worried about pointers and references so we can consider this good enough. This is also known as "Fast and Loose Reasoning is morally correct." <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/publications/danielsson-et-al-popl2006.html">[13]</a></p><hr><h1 id="category">Category</h1><p>The next term we need to dive into is a category. A category is an algebraic structure that models objects and their relationships with each other.</p><p>Below we can see a category of int, string, and float. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Taken from article by Nikolay Grozev <a href="https://nikgrozev.com/2016/03/14/functional-programming-and-category-theory-part-1-categories-and-functors/">[5]</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The category is the entire chart. It\'s how we convert from int to string, float to string, or int to float, or float to int. </p><p>Now while in practice, a functor is just a thing we can map over, it has a more advanced explanation. In category theory, a functor is a transformation between two categories <a href="https://nikgrozev.com/2016/03/14/functional-programming-and-category-theory-part-1-categories-and-functors/">[5]</a>. This is a transformation of the <strong>entire category.</strong> </p><p>For example, we can transform the entire category above with a <code>List</code> functor. The relationships between all of the types goes from a function like <code>toString</code> to <code>map(func)</code> or  <code>map(toString)</code>. This also applies to <code>toFloat</code>, <code>round</code>, and any other functions in our category.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/blog/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Taken from article by Nikolay Grozev <a href="https://nikgrozev.com/2016/03/14/functional-programming-and-category-theory-part-1-categories-and-functors/">[5].</a></figcaption></figure><hr><h1 id="endofunctor">Endofunctor</h1><p>Now that we have functors and categories, let\'s discuss endofunctors. An endofunctor is a functor that transforms a category into itself. </p><p>I spent several hours trying to grok this, and more importantly, understand how it\'s relevant in software. After reading <em>many</em> articles I stumbled on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XGFFMPHG0o"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XGFFMPHG0o">this talk [6]</a> </a>by <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielaSfregola">@<a href="https://twitter.com/DanielaSfregola">DanielaSfregola</a></a> and it clicked.</p><p>For all intents and purposes, all functors in programming are endofunctors. A functor is really just metadata around a value that allows us to map over it.</p><p>The objects in our category are our types, and the arrows are the relationships between those types. These relationships are fundamental to the language so we can\'t just create a wrapper (functor) that changes how these types are interrelated. </p><p>We can\'t change how types are related unless we change the definition of the type altogether. Even in JavaScript, which has gnarly behaviors around <code>NaN</code>, <code>undefined</code>, and other types, the relationship between them is still defined in the spec and can\'t be changed with a simple functor.</p><p>Practically speaking, all functors in programming are endofunctors. There are all sorts of nuanced exceptions to this rule but those are out of scope here. Think of it like physics 101 when we pretended friction wasn\'t a thing.</p><p>Seriously though, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XGFFMPHG0o">that talk</a>, I closed so many tabs after watching that talk.</p><hr><h1 id="monoid">Monoid</h1><p>Cool cool, cool cool cool. We\'ve defined some of the scariest terms in functional programming, let\'s move on to monoids. </p><p>A monoid is a category with one object. A monoid has three important rules: identity, composition, and associativity. In programming, it\'s a wrapper around an object that enforces these rules.</p><ul><li><strong>Identity: </strong>This states that there must be a way to use the monoid such that it returns itself.</li><li><strong>Composition: </strong>This states that we must be able to combine values using the monoid.</li><li><strong>Associative: </strong>This states that the order of operations remains constant so <code>(a +b) + c === a + (b + c)</code>.</li></ul><p>If these seem vague and generalized, well thats how abstract math works. Let\'s look at a practical example, a string monoid. <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/erlang-conferences-production/media/files/000/000/760/original/Daniela_Sfregola_-_A_Pragmatic_Introduction_to_Category_Theory.pdf?1510238446">[9]</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/3f97a78df599085a01bd8663e80cc9ec.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Above, we can see our <code>StringMonoid</code> with an <code>identity</code> value and a <code>compose</code> function.</p><p>We can use the compose function to produce a new string.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/5a095ebd187f2be8098bd5ba2a05c2fa.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If we compose with the identity value we get the same value.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/571a8bab94ee65d77013aef7913b9c23.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Finally, if we call compose on the same arguments it doesn\'t matter which pair we do first.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/7f76d38e33fbed7a2a82c7a303fec776.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here are some other examples of monoids in JavaScript:</p><ul><li>Adding and multiplying numbers (with 0 and 1 as the identity value respectively).</li><li>Joining multiple arrays.</li><li>Composing multiple functions together.</li></ul><hr><h1 id="monads">Monads</h1><p>We did it! We made it to Monads.</p><p>Before we dive in let\'s take a step back. Functors and monoids were both wrappers around a value that allow us to execute operations on them. In the case of functors it was <code>map</code> in the case of monoids it was <code>compose</code>, where compose is a single operation.</p><p>Now monads. Monad\'s are both a functor and a monoid. That doesn\'t make this any simpler though. Let\'s define this in simpler terms.</p><p>A monad is a wrapper around some value that makes it easier to compose functions around it. This is often used to abstract away things like API calls or IO. In fact a <code>Promise</code> is a monad.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/b5d20d2d6c2dace042376db4810336dd.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If we look at these  types above, we have a <code>Wizard</code> and a function that returns a <code>Promise&lt;Wizard&gt;</code>. This promise allows us to compose functions on top of it without worrying about the underlying IO needed to go fetch a <code>Wizard</code> from the server.</p><p>Lets break down further.</p><p>A monad is based on a simple symmetry — A way to wrap a value into a context, and a way to unwrap the value from the context <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-monads-made-simple-7856be57bfe8">[10]</a>.</p><h3 id="lift">Lift</h3><p>A monad allows us to <em>lift</em> a type into the monad context. In this case we\'re going from <code>Wizard</code> to <code>Promise&lt;Wizard&gt;</code>. The process of wrapping the <code>Wizard</code> in a <code>Promise</code> is called lifting.</p><h3 id="map-function map() { [native code] }1">Map</h3><p>A monad also allows us to map from one wrapped type to another. So we can call <code>wizardPromise.then(joinGryffindor).then(learnExpelliarmous)</code> to update the underlying wizard in the promise. </p><p>I should mention that the monad <code>map</code> is the same <code>map</code> we get with a functor. This is because monads are a type of functor.</p><p>Now it\'s worth noting that Promises don\'t explicitly provide a <code>map</code> function, but <code>then</code> gets us close enough.</p><h3 id="flatmap">FlatMap</h3><p>Finally, monads give us a way of going from <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Wizard&gt;&gt;</code> to <code>Promise&lt;Wizard&gt;</code>. We should be able to have an arbitrarily nested monad and get to the original underlying value. We should also be able to do a <code>flatMap</code> on it. This is commonly done with a <code>chain</code> function.</p><h2 id="back-to-monads">Back to Monads</h2><p>Now it\'s worth noting that Promises don\'t perfectly map to monads, but they\'re close enough to understand the data type.</p><p>This also seems like a good time to reiterate, monads are an advanced abstract mathematical type. We\'re bringing these into our understanding of programming. They don\'t always line up perfectly with every construct in JavaScript. That\'s okay! </p><p>The point here isn\'t to make our code perfectly mathematical, we\'re just trying to understand some of the advanced math that powers our languages.</p><hr><h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h1><p>I\'m going to admit.

Now we have one last bit of scary functional jargon, lambdas.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/blog/mary-had-a-little-lambda/lambda-diagram.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h1 id="lambda">Lambda</h1><p>A lambda is an anonymous function that can be treated like a value.<a href="https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon"> [2]</a></p><p>We actually saw some of these in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/what-the-functor/">previous post</a>.

We then pass this as an argument to <code>map</code>. We could also just pass this anonymous function directly like so:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/matthew-gerstman/61fb080c43c384ecc6d34bc7fba30ce3.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This is a common pattern, passing a lambda, or an anonymous function to a <a href="http://matthewgerstman.com/functional-programming-fundamentals/">higher order function</a>.</p><h1 id="lambda-calculus">Lambda Calculus</h1><p>Now the scarier term Lambda Calculus. Let\'s break this down. Lambdas are anonymous functions, we just learned that. </p><p>Why don\'t we define calculus now? If we pull up the dictionary definition we get the following</p><blockquote><em>A method of computation or calculation in a special notation (as of logic or symbolic logic. <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calculus">[3]</a></em></blockquote><p><strong>Lambda Calculus is just a formal way of defining functions using special notation. Less scary now, right?</strong></p><p>Let\'s dive just a little more into it. Lambda Calculus, or the formal notation for defining functions, is composed of three elements <strong>variables, functions, </strong>and <strong>applications</strong>. <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lambda-calculus/">[4]</a></p><p>I\'m going to go ahead and heavily paraphrase <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lambda-calculus/">this great article from learn x in y minutes</a>.</p><h2 id="variables">Variables </h2><p>We know these, variables are used in programming all the time, and we can name them anything. Lets go with one named <code>x</code>. <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lambda-calculus/">[4]</a></p><h2 id="function">Function</h2><p>We know these too! We use functions in our code, and that\'s why you\'re reading an article on functional programming. In lambda calculus they use a special syntax: <code>λ&lt;parameters&gt;.&lt;body&gt;</code>. As an example <code>λx.x</code> is the identity function. <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lambda-calculus/">[4]</a></p><h2 id="application">Application</h2><p>This is a new word, but we see this all the time too. This is the act of calling a function. So if a function is the function declaration, this is the actual function call.</p><p>The syntax for this even involves parentheses! <code>(λx.x)a</code> calls the identity function with the argument <code>a</code>.</p><p>Here\'s a useful table taken from the <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lambda-calculus/">article mentioned above.</a> <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lambda-calculus/">[4]</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Syntax</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n<th>Explanation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable</td>\n<td><code>&lt;name&gt;</code></td>\n<td><code>x</code></td>\n<td>a variable named “x”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function</td>\n<td><code>λ&lt;parameters&gt;.&lt;body&gt;</code></td>\n<td><code>λx.x</code></td>\n<td>a function with parameter “x” and body “x”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Application</td>\n<td><code>&lt;function&gt;&lt;variable or function&gt;</code></td>\n<td><code>(λx.x)a</code></td>\n<td>calling the function “λx.x” with argument “a”</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This took me a while to grok.

      '<p>In 2012 I spent my first summer as an intern in the Bay Area. While it was a invaluable experience, there\'s so much I wish I knew before then. Here\'s a run-through of everything I wish I knew.</p><p><em>Note: While I mention the Bay Area a few times in this post, this is really relevant to any location.</em></p><h1 id="application-process">Application Process</h1><p>Apply early and often. Interviews are a numbers game. The more companies you apply to, the better chance you’ll have. Interview processes for internships range in difficulty, but most will put you through a technical interview.</p><p>Most technical interviews focus on data structures. If you haven\'t taken that course yet, I would recommend getting ahead as most of it directly translates to the interview process. I also highly recommend the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQP0Pt">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> for practice. </p><p>Also I would definitely recommend applying to all of the big companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc). Even if you don’t get the internship this summer, you’ll put yourself on their radar in the future.</p><p>I do have some more advice on the subject though.</p><h3 id="real-interviews-don-t-tell-you-what-kind-of-problem-it-is-in-advance-">Real interviews don\'t tell you what kind of problem it is in advance.</h3><p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQP0Pt">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>, problems are broken down by strings, arrays, trees, searches, sorts, etc. In a real interview you\'re going to get a vague prompt and have to figure out what kind of problem it is.</p><h3 id="failure">Failure</h3><p>You\'re going to fail a lot of interviews before you pass one. Technical interviews are hard and require a lot of practice, don\'t get discouraged. Do <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQP0Pt">practice problems</a> with your friends and keep your head up. Interviewing is a skillset completely separate from day to day coding, and unfortunately it\'s one you need to master.</p><h3 id="your-last-interview-has-no-bearing-on-the-current-one-">Your last interview has no bearing on the current one.</h3><p>If you bombed the last interview, shrug it off and move on. I know it\'s a stressful situation but do your best. This is doubly true for onsite interviews where you have multiple rounds in a row.</p><p>Here\'s a tip on interviews, you really only need to get one person excited about hiring you. The rest can be lukewarm. If you pass that bar you\'ll probably get an offer.</p><h2 id="number-of-internships">Number of Internships</h2><p>I recommend most people try and get two internships while they\'re in college. Usually it\'s the summers before Junior and Senior year.</p><p>You should still look for ways to write code during your first Summer (before Sophomore year). Apply to small (and big) companies, volunteer at a nonprofit, or just build an app and publish it. </p><p>Get <em>something </em>to put on your resume each summer.</p><h1 id="big-vs-small-companies">Big vs Small Companies</h1><p>One of the bigger decisions you’ll make is whether to go to a big or small company. Here are some of the pros of each.</p><h2 id="small-company">Small Company</h2><ul><li><strong>Wide variety of projects.</strong> Startups have more projects than they have resources. You’ll be able to work on projects across the entire tech stack and learn what they like.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Access to leadership. </strong></strong></strong>At a startup you’ll much more access to the leadership than you would at a company like google.</li></ul><h2 id="big-company">Big Company</h2><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Structured internship programs. </strong></strong></strong>The big companies essentially create a summer camp for their interns. They make sure you’re constantly entertained with activities. They’ll also set you up with a mentor.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Pay/Housing.</strong></strong></strong> The bigger companies will usually pay you more and set you up with housing.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Resume.</strong></strong></strong> People are shallow, Google will always look great on your resume.</li></ul><h1 id="resume">Resume</h1><p>Your resume should always fit on one page. Most recruiters will go through dozens of resumes at once and spend 30 seconds on each of them. A short resume that’s all quality content will sell better than a long one with a lot of fluff.</p><p>I know the one page thing seems daunting at first, but trust me on this one. Here’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elons-musk-resume-all-on-one-page-2016-4">an example of Elon Musk’s resume</a> shortened to one page. Google Docs has a ton of great templates these days.</p><p>Also, always submit your resume as a PDF. You never know how a <code>.docx</code> or <code>.pages</code> file is going be displayed on someone else\'s machine, or even worse, their printer.</p><p>One last thing, use your personal email. You won’t have your school email forever and you never know who you’re going to want to reach out to in 5 years. If it’s not already, I recommend your email be some version of firstname.lastname@gmail.com.</p><h1 id="once-you-start-your-internship">Once You Start Your Internship</h1><p>Always be aware that your internship is a 3 month long interview process. People will be submitting feedback on you. If they like you they’ll often extend an offer for when you graduate. Also remember that the interview process is a two way street. I’d recommend paying attention to how happy the full time employees are.</p><h1 id="intern-community">Intern Community</h1><p>The Bay Area brings in over 5,000 interns every summer. Some of the friends you make now will be both friends and industry connections you have for the rest of your career.</p><p>There will also be lots of intern focused events that are great for both social and professional networking. Keep in mind when attending these, the hosts always have their own motives. Usually they’re looking to recruit engineers. You’ll still get a lot of value out of attending these events, but be aware no one is hosting it out of kindness of their heart.</p><h1 id="some-general-advice">Some General Advice</h1><p><strong>Always be learning. </strong>The tech industry moves incredibly quickly and you should always make sure you’re keeping up. If you ever feel like you’ve stopped learning at your job, it’s probably time to look for a new one.</p><p><strong>Find Mentors</strong>. The best thing you can do for your career is to find people you look up to. They don\'t need to be that far ahead of you, 2-3 years is enough. But they should have seen enough of the road ahead to give you direction. But remember this is your life, do what you think is best.</p><p><strong>Don’t Drop Out. </strong>You’ll find a lot of people trying to convince you to drop out and join their startup, don’t. Your CS degree will be valuable for at least the first 10 years of your career. I see lots of candidates who know how to code but can’t handle real engineering tasks, you’ll learn that in school.</p><p><strong>Ship Code. </strong>Build apps, web-apps or whatever you feel like, but get the experience of writing something that people actually use. I meet lots of recent college grads who can pass a technical interview but have never watched someone use their software. It’s humbling to say the least. Also, try adding features to something you wrote a year ago. You’ll learn a lot about writing maintainable code that way.</p><p><strong>Learn Git</strong>. Learn how git works and upload everything you write to github. Github will eventually be your second resume. Don’t be embarrassed about publishing your code. Git is one of the most important tools you’ll use in the industry and most schools don’t teach it. <em>Disclaimer: Make sure you’re allowed to upload your class projects.</em></p><h1 id="the-most-important-advice">The Most Important Advice</h1><p><strong>You are in charge of your own happiness.</strong> Remember this forever. I grew up on the east coast and firmly belong here. I spent years trying to convince myself to like the Bay Area, when really it just wasn\'t a good fit.</p><p>Try everything once, live somewhere you\'re not used to, but when it comes time to figure out what makes you happy, do what you think is best.</p>',

      "<p>Almost weekly someone will ask me <em>how do I put together a tech talk.</em> I'd like to think I've gotten pretty good at answering. In fact I've gotten so used to sharing <em>The Matthew Gerstman Method </em>that it might as well be it's own talk.</p><p>That's too meta for me, so I went with a blog post. This probably isn't that different from anyone else's strategy, but it works for me.</p><h1 id=\"figuring-out-the-topic\">Figuring Out The Topic</h1><p>The very first step is figuring out what I actually want to talk about. Different talks will come from variou sources of inspiration.</p><p>My <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkRyjXDpYqg\">Functional Programming talk</a> came out of a desire to evangelize Lodash after we migrated from <a href=\"https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/09/migrating-from-underscore-to-lodash/\">Underscore at Dropbox</a>. I gave a talk on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XdasrstCc\">Salary Negotiation </a>that is filled with advice I've given on repeat.</p><p>Currently I'm developing three talks. Building a Typed and Code Split React App, TypeScript: Seeing Past The Hype, and Nothing Generic About It. All three of these came directly out things I've learned at Dropbox. More importantly, these are things I'm passionate about and that should come through when I'm delivering them.</p><h1 id=\"outlining\">Outlining</h1><p>The next step is the rough technical outline. I usually do this offline, walking around Manhattan, running errands, or cleaning my apartment. I generally try to get myself into a headspace where my thoughts can run wild and I can think about the general structure for the talk.</p><p>I might think a little bit about how I want to handle certain subjects, and ideas for code samples may come up, but overall it's high level.</p><p>When I get home I start to type it up. I plug away into <a href=\"http://paper.dropbox.com\">Paper</a> and build a proper outline. Seeing it in front of me, I can reorganize topics and start to add more detail as it comes to me.</p><h1 id=\"research\">Research</h1><p>This is often the hardest part of the talk. Researching the topic.</p><p>I try to learn everything I can about the subject I'm talking about and I make sure to cite sources. At this point it's more of a blog post than a tech talk. It's a lot of information in a Paper doc that I can share.</p><p>At this point I'm generally just copy pasting from articles I find into Paper and saving where I got the info.</p><p>Slowly this mass of content will become actual slides. I'll put in line breaks and figure out the flow of my talk. This is also where I write any relevant sample code.</p><p>Also, this is when jokes usually start coming to me. I might start stockpiling gifs, although that's not necessarily important yet.</p><h1 id=\"starting-the-slides\">Starting The Slides</h1><p>At this stage I export from Paper to markdown and switch over to <a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck\">mdx-deck</a>. It's a really nice project that lets you write your slides in markdown and include live code samples. If you're curious, I host my slides on Netlify.</p><p>I'm not terribly concerned about getting my slides perfect. The most important thing for now is the content itself. Secondly, I like to make sure theres comic relief when things get too technical.</p><p>Arguably, you should avoid spending time refining your slides here because they're so likely to change. Fonts, colors, and alignment can all wait. </p><p>Instead, I start running through the slides at home. I time myself on each practice run. More often than not, I need to cut content rather than add more, but your mileage may vary.</p><h1 id=\"workshopping\">Workshopping</h1><p>This is one of my favorite parts, testing the talk out with friends. I usually find a couple of co-workers and give the talk to them in private. This allows me to see how the talk flows when someone is listening, how they respond to various things I might say, and most importantly, gather feedback.</p><p>Often I'll get feedback that something was confusing, or a few slides could have been rearranged. I might also get feedback like <em>this is irrelevant,</em> or <em>you need to expand on this</em>. Most importantly, I get to see if my jokes are funny.</p><p>When I was first getting started, I would have someone count my <em>ums</em>. This is a really useful exercise, because it gets you in the habit of breaking your awkward mannerisms. We all have them, and it takes practice to fix them.</p><p>I also recommend timing yourself, and asking your friend(s) to hold feedback until the end. I usually give them a pen and paper to take notes that I can hold onto afterwards.</p><h1 id=\"refining\">Refining</h1><p>After two or three of these one on one sessions I'm in refinement mode. Getting the talk down to a science, and making sure I have all my points together.</p><p>This is the stage when I start trying to make my slides perfect. I check that everything is aligned properly. I also start adding speaker notes. </p><p>There's one thing I don't do though; I don't memorize anything. I make it a point to speak naturally every time I give the talk. This makes the delivery feel much more organic. I avoid writing down full sentences in my speaker notes and stick to bullet points. If I miss something during any given speech it's not that big a deal.</p><p>I also make sure my gif game is on point. To be honest, I spend hours on Google images looking for the perfect gifs.</p><h1 id=\"practicing-in-public\">Practicing In Public</h1><p>The talk is 90% done now, but it still hasn't been given to an audience. I'll set a date with a local meetup and give the talk to a smaller group, usually 50-100 people. This is my first chance to give the talk in public and see how it lands. Usually people will come up to me after the talk and ask questions or give feedback. This is very helpful for the final version.</p><p>From here on, I'll update my slides as necessary, change up any jokes that didn't get laughs, and really hone my delivery.

      "<p><em>Originally published on the <a href=\"https://dropbox.tech/frontend/migrating-from-underscore-to-lodash\">Dropbox Tech Blog</a></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>By Matthew Gerstman and Stacey Sern • September 5, 2018</strong></p>\n\n<p>The core Dropbox web application is 10 years old and used by millions of users per day. Hundreds of front-end engineers across multiple cities actively work on it. Unsurprisingly, our codebase is very large and somewhat irregular. Recently written parts have thorough test coverage, other parts haven't been updated in years.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past two years we've worked to modernize our front-end stack. We've successfully moved from CoffeeScript to TypeScript, from jQuery to React, and from a custom Flux implementation to Redux. Having completed these migrations we identified our utility library, Underscore, as one more candidate for migration.</p>\n\n<h2>Why migrate?</h2>\n\n<p>When we began our research, Underscore hadn't seen an update in 3 years. Newer developers were hesitant to use a deprecated library. We wanted to fill that need.</p>\n\n<h3>Benefits of Lodash</h3>\n\n<p>Lodash is a utility library composed of many individual modules. It can be used as a complete library, as individual modules, or as a custom build consisting of just the necessary functions. It's the single most used utility library on the web, and as a result is extremely battle tested. It heavily optimizes for front-end CPU performance in a way that Underscore doesn't. For example, Lodash is implemented to take advantage of JIT in JavaScript engines.</p>\n\n<p>It also offers new features that promote functional programming. For example, it's well suited for building a functional selector layer between React and Redux, two technologies we use in our front-end codebase. Finally, Lodash is actively maintained, which is critical to long-term support of the library.</p>\n\n<h2>Setting a strategy for migration</h2>\n\n<p>We wanted to use a strategic migration approach. By gathering consensus from our internal community, doing research first, and constructing a bespoke build for our environment before migrating our entire codebase, we hoped to avoid surprises and ensure a smooth transition.</p>\n\n<h3>Getting alignment with a Web Enhancement Proposal</h3>\n\n<p>At Dropbox we have a process called Web Enhancement Proposals (WEPs). Similar to Python's PEPs or JavaScript's TC39 process, WEPs are a way to propose large-scale changes to our web infrastructure. They provide a forum for discussion and help us reach consensus before making major technical decisions.</p>\n\n<p>We wrote a WEP proposing the migration from Underscore to Lodash. This gave the broader engineering team a chance to provide feedback and raise concerns. The proposal outlined our reasoning, the benefits we expected, and our migration strategy.</p>\n\n<h3>Doing the research first</h3>\n\n<p>Before writing any code, we did extensive research. We needed to understand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Which Underscore functions were actually being used in our codebase</li>\n<li>How those functions mapped to Lodash equivalents</li>\n<li>Whether any functions had different behavior between libraries</li>\n<li>What our final bundle size would look like</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We wrote scripts to analyze our codebase and identify all Underscore usage. This gave us a complete picture of what we'd need to migrate.</p>\n\n<h3>Choosing the right tools</h3>\n\n<p>We evaluated several approaches for the migration:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Manual find-and-replace</strong>: Too error-prone and time-consuming</li>\n<li><strong>Automated codemods</strong>: Promising, but needed careful testing</li>\n<li><strong>Aliasing Underscore to Lodash</strong>: Quick but risky</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We ultimately chose a hybrid approach: automated codemods for the bulk of the work, with manual review for edge cases.</p>\n\n<h3>Building the bundle</h3>\n\n<p>One of our key concerns was bundle size. We didn't want to ship the entire Lodash library if we were only using a subset of functions.</p>\n\n<p>We used Webpack to create a custom Lodash build containing only the functions we actually needed. This required some experimentation to get right.</p>\n\n<p>We should note that the unminified Webpack bundle came with a fair amount of Webpack cruft: comments, dependency resolution, and other snippets Webpack needs to do its job. However we decided that letting Bazel minify and remove most of this was a reasonable tradeoff to make.</p>\n\n<h2>Migrating the Codebase</h2>\n\n<p>It was finally time for the big scary part: migrating the codebase. Everything until now had been implemented in a vacuum; we hadn't yet gone out and touched anyone else's code.</p>\n\n<p>We constructed a comprehensive mapping table showing how each Underscore function mapped to its Lodash equivalent. Some functions had direct 1:1 mappings, others required slight modifications, and a few had no direct equivalent.</p>\n\n<h3>Splitting the work</h3>\n\n<p>Rather than attempt a big-bang migration, we split the work into phases:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Migrate functions with direct 1:1 mappings</li>\n<li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Migrate functions requiring slight modifications</li>\n<li><strong>Phase 3</strong>: Handle edge cases and custom wrappers</li>\n<li><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Remove Underscore entirely</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Each phase was deployed separately, giving us time to catch and fix any issues before moving on.</p>\n\n<h3>Exactly one bug</h3>\n\n<p>Despite migrating thousands of lines of code, we only encountered a single bug in production. It was related to a subtle difference in how Underscore and Lodash handle empty arrays in their <code>_.compact</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>This speaks to the thoroughness of our preparation and testing. The research phase paid off.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Migrating from Underscore to Lodash was a significant undertaking, but it was worth it. We now have a modern, well-maintained utility library that's better suited to our needs.</p>\n\n<p>The key lessons we learned:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do your research first</strong>: Understanding the problem space saved us countless hours later</li>\n<li><strong>Get organizational buy-in</strong>: The WEP process helped us build consensus</li>\n<li><strong>Migrate incrementally</strong>: Phased rollouts are safer than big-bang changes</li>\n<li><strong>Test thoroughly</strong>: Our extensive testing caught issues before they reached production</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you're considering a similar migration, we hope our experience helps guide your approach.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Read the original article on the <a href=\"https://dropbox.tech/frontend/migrating-from-underscore-to-lodash\">Dropbox Tech Blog</a></em></p>",

      "<p><em>Originally published on the <a href=\"https://dropbox.tech/frontend/the-software-engineering-lifecycle--how-we-built-the-new-dropbox\">Dropbox Tech Blog</a></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>By Matthew Gerstman • September 15, 2020</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, we released <a href=\"https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product-tips/new-dropbox-helps-manage-work-and-home\">a whole bunch of new features</a> to Dropbox Plus, our paid plan for personal users. While we started as a storage company, we've grown to be a hub to manage your digital life. About 150 people worked on this launch: engineers, product managers, designers, copywriters, and many more.</p>\n\n<p>Through a combination of luck and happenstance, I was fortunate enough to touch almost every part of this launch. I got to see how different teams work, as I joined each at different stages of the software engineering lifecycle.</p>\n\n<p>In this post I'll distill my experience working on different parts of the launch, and discuss how we think about building software. I'll go into a few technical details, but mostly focus on how teams organize and operate.</p>\n\n<h2>Problem Scoping</h2>\n\n<p>Toward the end of 2019 we had a realization: while we had built incredible new products for our professional users like the <a href=\"https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product-tips/new-dropbox\">new Dropbox</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/transfer\">Dropbox Transfer</a>, it had been a while since we delivered new value to our personal users.</p>\n\n<p>We set out to change that. We put together a team focused exclusively on helping personal users manage their digital lives. At the time we didn't know how much those lives and needs would change the year to come, but in hindsight our timing was great.</p>\n\n<p>Our contract with our customers is simple: We build products that people like so much that millions of them pay for it. As a rule, we aspire to be worthy of trust in all situations. You are our customer, not our product.</p>\n\n<p>Merging our mission and our values, we came up with a simple plan: ship a bunch of timely, useful features to our most loyal users. After a lot of discussion about what to build, we came up with the new Dropbox Plus.</p>\n\n<p>We knew our users wanted <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/features/cloud-storage/computer-backup\">computer backup</a>. This was finally possible thanks to our <a href=\"https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine\">brand new sync engine</a>, which we had just finished rolling out in June.</p>\n\n<p>We did weeks of customer research and learned that users wanted a handful of specific new features from us. They wanted a special folder where they could store their most important files, this became <strong>Vault</strong>. They wanted to be able to rewind their entire Dropbox to recover from ransomware or accidental deletion, this became <strong>Rewind</strong>. They wanted a way to track down and free up space on their computer, this became <strong>Computer Backup</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Family</h3>\n\n<p>One feature stood out as particularly important: <strong>Family</strong>. We learned that many of our users were sharing their personal Dropbox accounts with family members. They'd share credentials, which was both insecure and inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>We decided to build a proper family plan. Each family member would get their own account with their own space, but they'd all be on one subscription. We'd build a special shared folder that the whole family could access.</p>\n\n<h2>Plan Before Coding</h2>\n\n<p>Before writing any code, we spent significant time in planning. This is critical for large projects with many dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>We held design reviews where designers presented mockups and gathered feedback. We held technical design reviews where engineers proposed architectures and discussed tradeoffs. We wrote detailed specs outlining exactly what we'd build.</p>\n\n<p>This upfront investment paid off. When we finally started coding, everyone knew what they were building and why.</p>\n\n<h3>Team Dynamics</h3>\n\n<p>Large projects require careful coordination between many teams. For Dropbox Plus, we had:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Desktop client team</strong>: Building the backup and sync features</li>\n<li><strong>Web team</strong>: Building the web UI for all features</li>\n<li><strong>API team</strong>: Building the backend services</li>\n<li><strong>Vault team</strong>: Building the secure folder feature</li>\n<li><strong>Rewind team</strong>: Building the recovery feature</li>\n<li><strong>Family team</strong>: Building the family plan feature</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each team had its own engineering lead, product manager, and designer. We held weekly syncs to keep everyone aligned.</p>\n\n<h2>Speeding Up Development</h2>\n\n<p>One of the biggest challenges in large projects is maintaining velocity. As teams grow and dependencies multiply, it's easy to slow down.</p>\n\n<p>We used several strategies to stay fast:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clear ownership</strong>: Each feature had a single team responsible for it</li>\n<li><strong>Parallel workstreams</strong>: Teams worked independently where possible</li>\n<li><strong>Integration points</strong>: We defined clear interfaces between systems early</li>\n<li><strong>Regular demos</strong>: Teams showed progress weekly to catch issues early</li>\n<li><strong>Automated testing</strong>: Comprehensive test coverage gave us confidence to move fast</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Milestones</h3>\n\n<p>We broke the project into clear milestones:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Internal Alpha</strong>: Get it working for Dropbox employees</li>\n<li><strong>External Beta</strong>: Invite a small group of users to test</li>\n<li><strong>Gradual Rollout</strong>: Slowly expand to all users</li>\n<li><strong>General Availability</strong>: Launch to everyone</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Each milestone had specific success criteria. We wouldn't move to the next phase until we met them.</p>\n\n<h2>Internal Alpha: Dogfooding</h2>\n\n<p>Before releasing to users, we released to Dropbox employees. We call this \"dogfooding\" - eating our own dog food.</p>\n\n<p>This was incredibly valuable. Employees found bugs, suggested improvements, and stress-tested the features in real-world scenarios. We got feedback from hundreds of internal users before a single external user saw the product.</p>\n\n<p>The feedback was sometimes brutal but always helpful. Engineers on other teams would file detailed bug reports. Executives would question design decisions. Everyone had opinions, and we listened to all of them.</p>\n\n<h3>Onboarding a new teammate</h3>\n\n<p>Midway through the project, I joined the Vault team. Vault was the secure folder feature - a special folder that required an additional PIN to access.</p>\n\n<p>The very first thing I did was set up a 1:1 with each and every person with whom I'd be working. We had engineers working on locking/unlocking the folder, serving APIs, updating the desktop app, and working on the existing frontend. We also had a product manager and a designer.</p>\n\n<p>I knew it was important to establish these relationships early on if I were to become an effective member of the team.</p>\n\n<h3>Joining Vault</h3>\n\n<p>When I joined Vault, the team had already been working for months. They had working prototypes, clear designs, and a solid technical plan.</p>\n\n<p>My job was to build the web frontend. I needed to create the UI for setting up Vault, accessing it, and managing it.</p>\n\n<p>I started by reviewing all the existing design docs and technical specs. I attended the team's daily standups and weekly planning meetings. I paired with other engineers to understand the codebase.</p>\n\n<p>Within two weeks, I had shipped my first feature: the Vault setup flow. Within a month, I was a fully productive member of the team.</p>\n\n<h2>Class Dismissed</h2>\n\n<p>By this point in the project, we were deep into implementation. The initial planning phase was over. Now it was all about execution.</p>\n\n<p>We held these 1:1s over Zoom as soon as the company had sent us all to work from home, rather than waiting until April. It was a shift for everyone but it worked. Over time I figured out who I'd be working with the most. I set up weekly 1:1s with them to make sure we stayed in sync from afar.</p>\n\n<h3>Shipping Our Team Coding Standards</h3>\n\n<p>As I worked on Vault, I noticed our team had different coding styles. Some engineers preferred functional programming, others object-oriented. Some wrote detailed comments, others preferred self-documenting code.</p>\n\n<p>I proposed we establish team coding standards. We held a meeting where everyone shared their preferences, then we voted on contentious points.</p>\n\n<p>The result was a document outlining our team's conventions. It wasn't perfect, but it gave us consistency. New code looked like it was written by one person, not five.</p>\n\n<h3>Nothing's Perfect</h3>\n\n<p>During Vault development, we experimented with a new internal technology called API-QL, a GraphQL-like query language for our internal APIs.</p>\n\n<p>It worked well in theory, but in practice it added complexity without enough benefit for our use case. After a few weeks, we decided to switch back to our standard REST APIs.</p>\n\n<p>There was an important lesson here: Ideas that work flawlessly on one project might not transfer to another. API-QL is a fantastic technology and we're continuing to invest in it, but it wasn't the right fit for this project at this time.</p>\n\n<h3>Reflecting</h3>\n\n<p>Looking back, the key to our success was balance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Balance between planning and execution</li>\n<li>Balance between speed and quality</li>\n<li>Balance between individual autonomy and team coordination</li>\n<li>Balance between shipping fast and getting it right</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We didn't always get the balance right, but we kept adjusting until we did.</p>\n\n<h2>Entrypoints</h2>\n\n<p>One technical challenge worth highlighting: entrypoints.</p>\n\n<p>Dropbox has a massive web codebase. To keep page load times fast, we split our JavaScript into many small bundles. Each page loads only the code it needs.</p>\n\n<p>For Dropbox Plus, we added many new pages: Vault setup, Rewind UI, Family management, etc. Each needed its own entrypoint.</p>\n\n<p>We used Webpack's code splitting to create these entrypoints automatically. When a user navigated to a new page, we'd load just the code for that page. This kept our bundle sizes small and our app fast.</p>\n\n<p>We also used dynamic imports to load code on-demand. For example, the Vault PIN entry dialog was loaded only when a user tried to access their Vault. This saved bandwidth for users who never used the feature.</p>\n\n<p>The result: despite adding significant new functionality, our page load times actually improved.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Building Dropbox Plus was a massive undertaking. It required coordination between dozens of teams, careful planning, and disciplined execution.</p>\n\n<p>The key lessons I learned:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Plan thoroughly before coding</strong>: The upfront investment pays off</li>\n<li><strong>Break large projects into milestones</strong>: Celebrate progress along the way</li>\n<li><strong>Dogfood your own products</strong>: Internal testing catches issues early</li>\n<li><strong>Establish clear team norms</strong>: Consistency makes collaboration easier</li>\n<li><strong>Stay flexible</strong>: Be willing to change course when something isn't working</li>\n<li><strong>Build relationships</strong>: 1:1s and regular communication are critical</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize for speed</strong>: Technical decisions should enable fast iteration</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you're working on a large software project, I hope these lessons help you ship something great.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Read the original article on the <a href=\"https://dropbox.tech/frontend/the-software-engineering-lifecycle--how-we-built-the-new-dropbox\">Dropbox Tech Blog</a></em></p>",
